"B079XX3P4R",2021-10-26,"This clock has many desirable characteristics: it's bright, dimmable, large letters which can be seen across a room, customizable features. But it has always run fast, as in about a minute a month. There is no way to adjust it. We use it in our family room where our TV is, and it often caused confusion about program start times. Recently, I decided I had had enough and decided to buy a new clock which actually kept time. Before doing that I decided to reach out to the American Lifetime company to see if I had missed anything or if they had a method to fix. Their suggestion was to reset the clock. When that didn't work, they pointed out to me that the one year warranty had expired July 2021 and the best they could do was offer me a $20 discount on another of their products. Hmmmm.

We were searching for something other than an actual Hallmark movie (My friend's cousin is addicted to them. No judgement. We were ready for something a bit MORE) and happened upon this. A friend had seen it once and gave it a strong vote. I had never heard of it. Sometimes you go into a movie blind and you just are so entertained you can't believe it is really happening. That was this movie. Twists and turns that are surprising and hilarious and a loving couple devoted to each other and to winning. Jason Bateman was perfect, the female lead (sadly spacing her name, she's famous for a reason) also incredible, the other couples in game night are charming. Watch it, you won't be sorry.

All the actors like the well known leads have such a GREAT chemistry - even right down to the extras. My favorite is the odd neighbor, the cop who comes off as very strange. I really can’t say much more - I don’t want to give away anything. It’s a fun “semi-wholesome” movie that can be watched on a date night (no chilling) or with a group.

"B079XX3P4R",2021-01-19,"""Game Night"" is among my favorite comedies to come out over the past few years. This high concept laugh-riot benefits from a creative script, fantastic visual direction and a wonderful cast. Max and Annie are a competitive couple who bonded over their love of gaming and trivia, and host a weekly ""game night"" with their friends. However, things take an interesting turn when Max's wealthy and successful brother Brooks is really kidnapped during a murder-mystery-style role-playing game. Convinced his disappearance is all ""part of the game,"" the group sets out to solve the mystery... only to get pulled into a real-life conflict and a life-or-death adventure. The writing is top-notch for such a silly film. The story is fun and fluid, with a great sense of pace and some clever and subversive twists to keep you on your toes. It's also just really darned funny - there are tons of laughs to be had with the film. I also absolutely adore the direction courtesy John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein. There are so many fun and engaging sequences, and some really creative choices being made. They also load the film with references to gaming at large - for example, fantastic establishing shots utilizing the ""tilt-shift"" photographic technique that makes them look like miniatures on a game board. Or a chase scene utilizing mounted camera angles similar to a racing video-game. It's very well-done. And the cast is just wonderful. I've always been a fan of lead star Jason Bateman, and he's as charming and likable as ever. I also gotta give special commendation to Rachel McAdams, who is adorable - and hilarious - as Annie. I was very pleasantly surprised by her comedic chops. But I gotta give the biggest shout-out to Jesse Plemons in a small but memorable supporting role as Max and Annie's creepy neighbor Gary. He supplies some of the film's biggest belly-laughs. As for the Blu-Ray? Well, it's a bit sparse on bonus content, really only featuring a gag-reel and a making-of featurette. But for what they are, they are good fun to watch. And as expected, the A/V quality is quite good for an HD release. The picture quality is nice and the audio sounds crisp and clean. It's just a shame that movies like this aren't getting proper 4K UHD physical releases. For a film that's as well-directed as this is, and loaded with as many visual flourishes as there are, this movie deserves to seen in 4K quality. I'd happily double-dip to own this on a 4K disc. But until that happens, the Blu-Ray is totally serviceable. If you're looking for a clever comedy, I absolutely have to give ""Game Night"" my highest recommendation. It's hilarious and well-made, and the Blu-Ray is a very solid release. 5 out of 5.","",0,NA,5,"R12A2EXG2M35SV","""Game Night""- One of the best mainstream comedies of the past decade!","TheoStix","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2021",2021,"January","Tuesday","2021/01","Q1",2021 Q1,"the United States"

"B002H09I0Y",2022-01-13,"Was this before or after the Truman Show? I google and it turns out before, about 1 year before, so you can see something was in the air. Certainly there is some connection here to counterintelligence, stage managed appearances, and public relations. All of these are tools of the rich and powerful, but the rest of us make do with going to the movies. I may have read a few things about this so forgive me if outside ideas bleed through. I would align this with The Parallax View in addition to the Truman Show. The stage-managed world is the ‘dark wood’ of either conspiracy or folklore. This is a fairy tale told to a rich man, the emperor, to show him that he has no clothes, but it’s okay - we, your loyal servants, will handle things for you. Part of Nicholas Van Orton’s problem I think is that he imagines he serves the common good rather than his own self interest. This illusion prevents him from embracing his role as the emperor more fully. Thankfully by the end of his “game” he is all better and happily hitting on waitresses again. That’s not fair, I know! She’s actually an actress playing a waitress. I’m sorry you might get the impression I don’t like this movie but it is one of my favorites. Only the irony collapses faster than the set crew can put it back together in my brain. No I get it, NVO is once again emotionally connected and able to have human relationships. I guess the servants have to make do with watching movies, or therapy.","",0,NA,4,"R10T2Y2NUSD83K","The rest of us have to make do with watching movies, or therapy","Bill Weaver","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2022",2022,"January","Thursday","2022/01","Q1",2022 Q1,"the United States"

"B002H09I0Y",2021-01-07,"The Game is a 1997 American thriller film directed by David Fincher, starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn, and produced by Propaganda Films and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. It tells the story of a wealthy investment banker who is given a mysterious gift by his brother - participation in a game that integrates in strange ways with his everyday life. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent. So, a bit of a confession on my part; I brought up the fact that I was watching this with some friends of mine, and the first thing they said was “You should tell me if you can guess the plot twist before the end!” I don’t know about anybody else, but I’m not really one of those people that...tries to guess plot twists? Not intentionally, at least? Some people might disagree, but in hindsight I honestly don’t feel like the “ultimate” plot twist is that hard to figure out. The harder part is making sense of the journey Nicholas (Douglass) finds forced upon him; it’s almost impossible to guess what could possibly happen next! As the description suggests the most intricate and intimate interactions in his life are invaded by an almost omniscient force that threatens his sense of security. Douglas - so intent on having control over his life that his standards cause much of the contempt other characters have for him - is metaphorically consumed by this loss of autonomy and changes into what is almost a completely different person as the plot develops alongside him. MIchael Douglas is the ultimate iceberg of emotional expression - and this makes him the perfect candidate for the role of Nicholas; there is an intensity about him that is always present that is buoyed by a sensitive amount of vulnerability and charm lying underneath the surface. The tiniest fluctuations in his voice and body language are indicative of the slightest amounts of terror, anger, and confusion that plague him. The feelings and elements that are most central to him at the time - anger, sadness, charisma, the works - are present in the most meticulous of amounts and create a well-balanced (but, slowly deteriorating) character that is easy to empathize with while still deserving what might be some pretty harsh snap-judgements. The “final reveal” of ‘The Game’ is equivalent to that of a shrug; more specifically, it’s a little underwhelming when the larger context of the story is taken into consideration (and, not to mention, the hell we know Nicholas had to go through to get there!). There isn’t much of a effort beyond the bare minimum to provide insight as to why Nicholas gets involved in this game, but I do see at least two recurring themes/elements that I find myself ruminating over: A) Money/Greed Does Nicholas come off as greedy and materialistic? Anyone would be hard pressed to say no, but perhaps it is worth taking into consideration what money means for him in the long run. Money is a consistency in his life that can’t consciously abandon him and is a tangible representation of the power he believes that he has in the most insignificant of social situations. Without it Nicholas has to make meaningful connections with other people in a way that he isn’t familiar with: by paying them the respect and dignity they deserve as an equal as opposed to someone he would otherwise deem inferior. B) Humanity/Humility It’s of no coincidence to me that as Nicholas’ journey comes to an end the relationship he has with other people changes significantly as well. When the film begins Nicholas is the clean cut definition of vain: even the tiniest of inconveniences (like, ink from a pen getting on one of his shirts) set him off in ways that makes his character distinguishably disagreeable. His stupor (in spirit) constantly seems to be the direct result of his inflated sense of self-importance and conceit. Typically I would be a bit upset about so little effort being put into answering questions related to “the why” of this game that Nicholas participates in, but in this case I can make a much needed exception. ‘The Game’ has a bit of a grandiose pride about itself that makes some of its attempt to “twist” seem overzealous, but it touches on key subjects that are thought-provoking and can naturally cause some introspection. “<U+0001D46B><U+0001D48A><U+0001D494><U+0001D484><U+0001D490><U+0001D497><U+0001D486><U+0001D493><U+0001D48A><U+0001D48F><U+0001D488> <U+0001D495><U+0001D489><U+0001D486> <U+0001D490><U+0001D483><U+0001D48B><U+0001D486><U+0001D484><U+0001D495> <U+0001D490><U+0001D487> <U+0001D495><U+0001D489><U+0001D486> <U+0001D488><U+0001D482><U+0001D48E><U+0001D486> <U+0001D48A><U+0001D494> <U+0001D495><U+0001D489><U+0001D486> <U+0001D490><U+0001D483><U+0001D48B><U+0001D486><U+0001D484><U+0001D495> <U+0001D490><U+0001D487> <U+0001D495><U+0001D489><U+0001D486> <U+0001D488><U+0001D482><U+0001D48E><U+0001D486>.” A glorious round of cat and mouse (Or, maybe mouse and cat?)

"B002H09I0Y",2020-01-08,"In The Game, Michael Douglas plays an investment banker who has pushed everyone out of his life. Once a palace brimming with personality, his towering family home has been reduced to but him and a sole maid who lives in a separate dwelling on the grounds. He avoids to all possibility anything involving emotion (or introspection), and convinces himself of his own excellence, that he has his life under perfect control. Until, that is, as a birthday present, his wayward younger brother brings him into the Game. The people of the Game tear down the central character’s life, destroying his self-induced façade piece by piece, until finally he is destitute and left for dead (literally waking at one point in a coffin south of the border). It is no accident that his new, barren “life” is a mirror of what has been developing inside of him emotionally, and it forces him to recognize the depth of his own passions and what matters most—namely, all the people he’s been pushing away. I believe I appreciate this most because it shows that characters are often forced into their position. Campbell speaks of heroes rejecting the Call before being pushed into action, and that’s what happens with this character. And for his arc to complete, he first has to be stripped of everything he knows and loves. All of his carefully designed defenses have to be laid smoldering before he finally accepts the call and finds out who he really is, facing no one other than he himself.","",0,NA,5,"R2SLOCUNBA58QI","One of my favorite movies","Monso","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2020",2020,"January","Wednesday","2020/01","Q1",2020 Q1,"the United States"

It gets progressively crazier until you finally just succumb because you're dying to find out what's really going on.

No doubt, this is one of his best performances, but the supporting performances by Sean Penn, Deborah Unger, and James Rebhorn--are also inspired. Critics have complained about the ending. I found it implausible myself, especially Douglas' reaction to the whole escapade. But then, the whole film is implausible--deliberately so. It like one big, long joke on you, the viewer.

That, I told them, would be an automatic ""D."" So here we are with, ""The Game"" in which all sorts of crazy things happen to the main character. Anything that could happen to him, did, no matter how fantastic. Since the people who controlled the Game had immense power and reach, the writers had carte blanche in creating plot points. And then . . . well, I can't say any more. In fact I've probably already said too much. I will add that in this story, the writer(s) evidently were told that anything goes. The result is so contrived that the last ten minutes dropped my rating from a possible 4 stars to 2 stars.

"B002H09I0Y",2017-10-11,"Do not try to reduce this film to only one meaning. It is obviously a film centered on the relationship between an elder son and his father when the father commits suicide in front of the child’s eyes when he is 48 and the child is about six or eight. The case is made more complex with the fact that there is a younger son who the elder son took care of as his brother, which is natural, but in a way oppressive in the absence of the father. Even trickier is the fact that the elder son has taken over the family estate (and business), has been married but is divorced and lives alone on the estate with the housekeeper of long ago, of the time when he was a child, hence who has known his father, though she is either older than she looks, and hence too old to take care of such an estate, or she was very young at the time of the suicide and hence cannot really remember much about the father. That connection to the past is rather loose since Ilsa should be at the least 20 at the time of the suicide and should have been hired when she was eighteen. But that is young for a servant who is now the housekeeper and has been for a long time. Otherwise forty years later she should be at retiring age and should have entered that service when she was rathe r 25 or 28. The second element is the rivalry between two brothers in the absence of the father who spectacularly stepped out of life. Then the whole shebang being devised by the younger brother, it is a very perverse way for him to remind his elder brother whose forty-eighth birthday is celebrated today that their father committed suicide on exactly the same occasion by jumping from the top of a high chimney onto the flagstones of a terrace behind the family estate. Perverse and morbid if not even worse than morbid. With a suicide note supposedly signed by the elder son, Nicholas or Nick, saying “Like my father before me, I choose eternal sleep.” Note this suicide note is slightly bizarre because of the present tense directed at Nicholas himself in the game. But it is supposed to be read after the death of the suicidee, and that is hyper important for the suicidee who would use the preterit, the past if you prefer, because he is before committing his suicide projecting himself mentally into what is going to happen after his suicide is in the past. And in the past, it would even be worse because the effect would be multiplied on Nicholas since it might mean for Nicholas in the game he is dead. This rivalry is enacted to the very end of the game: harsh confrontation of the two brothers in the night in some San Francisco street stairs; the “accidental” killing of Conrad, the younger brother, by Nicholas on the roof of the skyscraper from which he is going to jump (or he would have been thrown over by one actor, if he had not jumped by himself), reenacting his father’s own suicide; and the new confrontation of the two after Conrad’s rebirth, resurrection and Nicholas great fall like some Humpty Dumpty. The last touch on the two brothers will be some kind of reconciliation when Nicholas suggests sharing the bill and Conrad accepts. So far that is banal and that would only make a good psychological melodrama, a drama with a good ending. But it is so much more. First, it is a game but the game is played in the real world with real means and with as little visible cheating as possible. All the bullets have been changed to blanks, though the gun Nicholas uses is from the “To Kill a Mockingbird” copy hiding a very powerful handgun (at the top of the library in the family estate), and at the end the actress playing Christine will have to convince Nicholas that his gun has real bullets whereas all the other guns used in the game only had blanks. This is slightly hard to believe for us because the shooting of a gun from the game punctures a tire in one of the chasing episodes, and the machine guns, or so, used by the CRS posse when they try to neutralize him when he gets berserk at Christine’s do make many holes in the setting. Of course, it is nothing but a cinema scene, so everything is fake but in the film, it is a real situation that probably explains the price of the game because of all the hundreds of bullets holes that have to be exploded artificially to make Nicholas believe the CRS agents are using real bullets. We, of course, can see the treachery at every corner in that labyrinthine plot, but Nicholas is not supposed to see it though at times it is slightly too obvious. Some scenes are even comical and emphasized as such by some comment from Nicholas like “Dinner for two, please” when Christine and Nicholas emerge from the two dumpsters behind a Chinese restaurant. As some would say, too good to be true. Second, we are projected into a world where crazy adventures can happen virtually but as if they were real. The film is a metaphor for virtual reality and games in that virtual world, virtual reality games that are so true that we believe they are real life. What is surprising is that several times, often to save their skins, some actors reveal it is a game, to the point that Nicholas believes it and wants to step out, to pull the curtain, to stop the game. And he discovers he cannot, and he also discovers the actors who have revealed it is a game are still in the game and still working for it, even when they are supposed to be in their own private life. An effort is even made to prove to Nicholas the main CRS man, Jim Feingold, is a simple family man with children visiting the zoo. A metaphor that could mean in the future (of the film as well as our own future) reality will be a blend of virtual reality and real reality and the divide between the two could be difficult to capture all the time. Beyond this idea of a metaphor it could also be considered as a real description of the mind of a person involved in some kind of psychotic episode (I will not say schizophrenia because psychiatrists are finally realizing schizophrenia does not exist and is only an extreme form of psychosis) when the real reality of his/her experience cannot be easily disentangled from the virtual reality of his/her second personality, the two sides of this split personality not being clearly separated and distinguishable for the subject him/herself. And a few times Nicholas thinks he is getting “crazy” and some of the characters, like his lawyer, Sam Sutherland, plays the game by insisting on his having to be worried or not, or the clerk at the hotel who plays surprised when Nicholas does not remember the night before there, though he did not come to that hotel on the night before. Why on earth do they have his credit card at the reception counter? The fourth approach is what some people insisted upon: it is a demonstration of how easily we can be manipulated by people; organizations, criminal or not, political or not; social networks or other “neutral” organizations of the type; not to speak of the media and the manipulators of the media, politicians, advertisers, and other gurus or preachers who want to influence the people into believing this or that, into doing this or that. The film, of course, shows that such a game requires hundreds of people being hired to play the game in very simple and ordinary structures, including the police and other security institutions, lawyers and businessmen or businesswomen. If we push aside this “game” concept and just consider the “manipulation” we can say this film reveals how easy it is to make someone believe in anything at any time with some immediate reactions from these people who are being manipulated, reactions that can be irreversible or quasi-irreversible. It is such manipulations that enable some political organizations to become powerful in spite of the unethical arguments they use in the shape of fear and anger. It is through such channels that racism, white supremacy, sexism, genderism and many other ideologies targeting a certain type of people they want to be ostracized and segregated against manage to make their opinions valid. Consider the case of Catalonia where only 40% or so of the people voted in an illegal referendum giving a majority, but if we consider that all those who would have voted no decided not to vote at all since the vote was illegal, 95% of 40% is only about 38% of the population. Even if we consider a 20% abstention rate we do not have a majority. This explains then that the President of Catalonia decided, probably under strong pressure from Europe and some countries like France, to go on negotiating with Madrid towards more autonomy but not secession. It is obvious when a situation like this referendum is dramatized by courts, governments, political organizations and businesses into some kind of civil strife that could lead to a civil war, people are pushed into corners and very strict and strong opinions and actions that do not represent reason or any sensible approach. As such this film should be pondered upon and meditated.

Sometimes i listen to it on Google play music, and smile at how intriguing and annoying it is all at the same time.. I didn't particularly care for the story line, but i just enjoyed watching Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. Both are outstanding actors. Each person was cast very well and played their parts that complimented the whole movie. I also have to say i have a crush on Armin Mueller Stahl. Who's always played an amazing lead as well as character actor. As for the movie itself? I would have had some serious trust issues after that. It would have been hard to know what's real or if the game was really over. Michael Douglas was handsome as always and phenomenal, even when serious, he was comedic in a very satiric way. The chick just got on my nerves, and the last thing in the world i would do , is invite someone out for dinner, who lies constantly.

"B002H09I0Y",2016-03-06,"I haven't seen the Criterion re-release of this movie so for all I know my ideas on it may be misinformed. Oh well! The movie seems to be a story about events that are distorted through the mind of a troubled character. In that respect, it reminds me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and Cronenberg's Spider. All three movies use a detailed, realistic tone and visual style only to upend the realism with paradox and absurdity. The Game, and all of its minutiae and complexity, comes to seem more and more like a paranoid delusion on Douglas's part. The smooth jet blacks and gleaming chrome finish of his life--so soothing and reassuring--start to reveal uncertainty and chaos beneath their surface. His biggest problem is that he believes he is either different or better than the people around him. The movie's most effective scenes come at the end when he walks into the CRS cafeteria and sees everyone--bankers, drivers, lawyers, cops, janitors--eating and socializing happily. I think this moment is meant to visualize Douglas's inner recognition of his own kinship with the rest of the people and world around him. Later, at his birthday party, all of his acquaintances are there, including Ilsa the family maid. She looks much different. Her hair is done up very well, and she bears herself like any of the other aristocrats. This incident drives home the point that Ilsa is more than his servant who makes his dinner and cleans up after him. She has as much dignity and humanity as anyone else at that party, including Douglas. The movie ends ambiguously because it really can't end any other way. Fincher, like Polanski and Cronenberg, creates a world in which surface details hint at deeper meanings but never reveal them. This world is like quicksand where people appear one moment, then vanish without a trace the next. I admire The Game very much, but ultimately its chill detachment makes Douglas and his rich boy problems a little too hard to care about. Despite her flaws, we always cared about Rosemary during her downward spiral. I can't say the same for Mr. Nicholas Van Orton.","",0,NA,4,"R19T41C53101AK","Beautiful Visual Style, Not Enough Compassion For Michael Douglas character","Mark C.

"B002H09I0Y",2015-11-25,"In this psychological thriller, wealthy investment banker Nicholas Van Orton's estranged brother Conrad gives him an unusual present for his 48th birthday: a voucher to a ""game"" from a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Nicholas is curious enough to take the psychological and physical tests required to participate, and soon finds his life take some very unexpected turns, as he struggles to know what is part of his real life, and what is staged as part of ""The Game"". He gets caught up with a waitress, but soon discovers that even she can't be taken at face value, as his world turns upside down, and nothing is as it seems. The film does have some weaknesses, not the least of which is that the not everything is plausible, and many critics have suggested ""holes in the plot"" - although a second viewing will in many cases show these to be less problematic than one might think. But rather than let this frustrate you (as it has understandably done for some viewers), just assume that the tests undertaken by Van Orton make the rest of the film possible, suspend your disbelief, and enjoy the ride, including the elements that may seem far-fetched. Be aware that there's multiple uses of the F word, and there's a few instances of blasphemy and crude humour; but for the most part it's the language and violence that have given this film its rating. What I enjoyed most is that you're seeing the action through the eyes of the protagonist Van Orton, and like him you don't know what is real anymore, and can't distinguish between what is being orchestrated and what is actual. The aim of ""The Game"" is to figure out what ""The Game"" is, and just when you think you've figured out what is actually happening, there's an unexpected twist that turns everything on its head. It is truly mind-bending, and the twists just keep coming. You can't be sure what is really going on even right to the very end, until the curtain is finally raised when all becomes clear in the last few minutes. And the ride there is a fun one; in fact I watched the film again immediately afterwards, enjoying it as much the second time with the benefit of knowing the outcome and understanding what actually is happening. While it's not as profound or intellectually satisfying as films like The Truman Show, it is still entertaining and offers similar kind of enjoyment. Another thing to be appreciated is how the protagonist's character develops in the course of the film. He's clearly a selfish and self-made man at the outset, with absolutely no concern for others, but the events in his life give Van Orton opportunity for self-reflection and change in a positive way. In some ways it's a redemption story, designed to steer Nicholas away from the emptiness that brought his own father to suicide. The Game is a clever film, and although I personally regret the need to include some of the elements that gave it an R rating, I did enjoy it as an entertaining, suspenseful, mind-bending ride. - GODLY GADFLY (November 2015)","",0,NA,4,"R1XGBHXMGJ3ENB","A psychological mind-bending thriller - don't over-think it, but enjoy the ride","BoardGameGeek reviewer EndersGame","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2015",2015,"November","Wednesday","2015/11","Q4",2015 Q4,"the United States"

"B002H09I0Y",2015-11-03,"It has been a while since I watched the thriller movie entitled, “The Game” starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. On those rare occasions, that I've gained an opportunity to view it on television, I always seem to gather a new perspective and/or enlarge my vision regarding life. Essentially, after Douglas's character survived various challenging levels of the rather annoying, and later death defying game, there’s one crucial scene that provided clarity, an affirmation, and a subsequent pause. At some point in the movie, he decided to place his faith in an appealing, perplexing, but mysterious woman. Normally, he would not entertain such a woman, but he’s compelled to do so, in an effort to retrieve information about his undesirable dilemma. Eventually, she drugs him, and when he abruptly awakes, he realizes that he was left for dead in a flimsy grave, which he was compelled to utilize some physical force, in order to escape. As he promptly walks out of a smoky cemetery (something nearby was burning), located in an unknown shanty town in Mexico. What followed was the most thought-provoking scene in the movie. Despite being rich, successful, handsome, he comes to realizes that he’s been betrayed. More importantly, he’s sitting in front of a small dirty shop, bungalow, who knows?? However, one thing is for certain, he’s lost, bleeding, penniless, filthy, grubby, and for a vulnerable moment, he begins to cry. At this point, I could only imagined that he thought, “I lived my entire life with such precision, how could I be in this predicament?? After briefly licking his wounds, noticeably, Douglas facial expression does a 180. His entire attitude changed from – “Woe is me” to “Let’s get to stepping.” At this very moment, I thought, thank GOD for the spirit of determination and perseverance. Thereafter, he promptly stood up, and started walking in hopes of finding a way out, which he did. He indeed became the hero in his own life. Thus, I determined that however long it takes a person to lick their wounds (i.e. one minute, one month, five years, etc.), after an unfortunate and/or unpleasant experience, is considered a defining moment. Needless to say, I can’t truthfully say that I’ve relished every single movie that Michael Douglas has starred in, but for those who need to witness how to properly lick your wounds, move forward, and become the hero that you’ve been waiting for, then watch this consummate, exemplary, and season actor show you how it’s done.","",4,NA,5,"R1JSWG6XEHL4IH","""Lick Your Wounds & Move Forward""","Yolanda D.

"B002H09I0Y",2014-08-07,"I can't believe how bad this film was. I found it to be utterly ridiculous well before the ending (which was truly embarrassing). For anyone who hasn't seen it, I would recommend this only if you aren't the critical type. I liked the premise and I'd heard good things about it, so I decided to check it out. VERY MILD SPOILER. I should have known I was in trouble when he brings the clown into his house. Guys like that (rich, powerful, ruthless, and lots of enemies) leave the clown on the ground and call the police. They might not even get out of their car to check it out, and they definitely don't bring it into their house. Admittedly, that's being picky, and I would have easily overlooked it, but it is literally the tip of the iceberg. Each sequence from this point on is built upon the previous and most would have been all but impossible to pull off in real life without serious risk to Douglas's life. The possibilities of what could have happened to him are endless, and no amount of ""explaining"" in the film changes that. Plus any number of their ""stunts"" could have drawn in the police and ended ""the game"". Like another reviewer said, this might have been awesome when I was eleven, but I found it pretty insulting as an adult. These guys got together, got baked, killed off the critical thinkers (if there were any) and then wrote this screenplay. Happens all the time, I'm sure. What's amazing is that they actually got the film made.","",11,NA,1,"R22RZ4ONF6QTUG","Awful film","Simple Man","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2014",2014,"August","Thursday","2014/08","Q3",2014 Q3,"the United States"

Michael Douglas is one of the finest actors and sexiest actors in hollywood and plays these types of character quite well. Sean Penn, is another great actor.

I wish more movies like this were made as the thriller genre has kind of died out. Douglas as usual is believable and a strong lead. He's the everyday man we can sympathise with and he never takes you out of a scene with shoddy acting. The setup of the movie is superb as we're given vague clues about what The Game actually entails and if it will even play a role in the main character's life. Kudos to the filmmakers for not rushing this early aspect. The story begins to build tension as we wonder if the so-called Game is behind the bizarre and dangerous situations that start to happen in Michael Douglas's life.

"B002H09I0Y",2013-12-13,"The Game (David Fincher, 1997) [originally posted 16Oct2000] Having now seen The Game, I've seen (aside from a few of the music videos) everything David Fincher has put his hand to. And now I'm even more depressed about the last five minutes of Fight Club, because to a one, all of Fincher's other films are purely fantastic from beginning to end. The Game follows Nicholas van Orton (Michael Douglas) through the eight days following his forty-eighth birthday. Van Orton's father committed suicide on his forty-eighth birthday, so Nicholas' deadbeat brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), decides to get him a really bang-up birthday present: a game from a shadowy company that's tailored to each player. All well and good, but after a day or so, Nicholas is starting to wonder whether it's a game at all, and exactly how far these people will go to protect their identities and create the fantasy world into which they're pushing Nicholas. Fincher's trademarks are all here—darkness, claustrophobia, quick camera cuts, little tricks that heighten the suspense for the viewer and allow him to identify a little better with the character the movie is following. It's wonderful stuff, aside from one little nagging out-of-character piece (Michael Douglas' character really is a complete jerk, and one wonders why he'd have ever agreed to get involved with The Game in the first place), but by the end of the film, that particular question is lost in the dust that the rest of the movie manages to kick up. It's not on the same reality-jarring level as Se7en was; more along the lines of Fincher's earlier contribution to the Alien series: a whole lot of fun, a great way to kill two and a half hours, and a movie that kind of manages to leave you feeling both good and slightly nauseated at the end. All that was missing were the big, gooey monsters. *** ½","",0,NA,4,"REM56JD1NAFNH","How to win friends and influence people.","Robert Beveridge","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2013",2013,"December","Friday","2013/12","Q4",2013 Q4,"the United States"

He , in actuality was 53 when he made this movie as he was born Michael Kirk Douglas on September 25th, 1944. Most movies are made a year before their theatrical release. So , let's say he was 52 to be fair. A 4 long years cry from 48 years old. I guess he could play the role of a 48 year old at 52 or 53 I guess. But , play a role closer to your age , which I guess whoever is reading this might think Michael is closer to that age & a majority , if not everyone will think that age is nothing , but a number. Those who think that must be really geriatrically old to say & think that. Great movie though , but why not have the movie set on Michael's character turning 52 or 53.

"B002H09I0Y",2013-08-01,"It's hard to review David Fincher's psychological thriller The Game without running the risk of giving away the twists and turns in this tense thriller. Let's backtrack a moment and consider Fincher's previous film, the harrowing Se7en. Though he had directed Alien 3 in 1992, 1995's Se7en upped the ante in the dread department. Though a great film in its own right, Se7en was, in a certain sense, a working out of ideas that came to fruition in The Game. And though Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman acquitted themselves very well in Se7en, Michael Douglas delivers a tour de force performance in The Game. In retrospect, it's hard to imagine anyone else soaking that character with as much self-loathing, guilt, arrogance and hostility. Douglas had already demonstrated his acting chops with Wall Street and Falling Down, so it's no great surprise that he was able to stand his ground against Fincher's twisting and shocking plot turns. And this plot sneaks up on you, subtle in the beginning then delivering massive blows to your emotions and sense of equilibrium. It's a testament to Douglas and Sean Penn's acting chops that they make this wild ride not only seem plausible but suffocatingly real. The first time I watched the film I remember grabbing my chair, all white knuckles at more than one point, gripped by Douglas' hallucinogenic ride. When a friend asked me what other films I'd seen that reminded me of this I couldn't honestly say. This was simply a brilliant one-off by Fincher and Douglas and a film that surprisingly, given that it relies on plot twists the viewer can't see coming, reveals subtle pleasures in repeat viewings.","",0,NA,5,"R34EWWNVPI7N8I","One of a Kind Thriller","E.

"B002H09I0Y",2013-07-09,"This movie is fun to watch and by being as sometimes unsettling as it is and often very frustrating the thing kind of pulls your psychological chain in an entertaining way, even though it is about as implausible as the most wild of sci-fi movies. However, technically I had problems with my DVD copy (stock number 22447). I watched it a couple of years back when I still did not an HDMI hookup and I used the three-wire, component-video alternative. My set (a Samsung) easily expanded the non-anamorphic image to fill out my 56-inch screen, and so THAT time it was a pleasure to watch, in spite of the loss of resolution with that kind of low-tech letterboxing. However, I recently watched it again (or, rather, tried to watch it), this time with a full HDMI connection from my player. Guess what? My Samsung TV actually LOSES some of its image-expansion and shaping abilities with the HDMI feed, and so the best I could do with the movie was watch it with the 4:3 setting, which delivered a reduced-size wide-screen image in the middle of the TV screen. What this movie needs (and perhaps later versions have it) is a true anamorphic squeeze, so that not only do we get more resolution with the image ""un-squeezed,"" but also so that my Samsung TV's more high-tech image expansion feature with the HDMI hookup will work properly. The version I have is too retro-tech, in spite of the THX certification, to operate to best effect with an HDMI link - at least with my set. Admittedly, the 5.1 sound quality was excellent. I am reluctant to purchase a replacement via Amazon, because I fear that what will be delivered will have the same limitations as the copy I have now.","",0,NA,3,"R36US5Q282OB59","Technical problems for some","Howard Ferstler","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2013",2013,"July","Tuesday","2013/07","Q3",2013 Q3,"the United States"

For wealthy Nicholas Van Orton, that may be a question that turned his life of stock options, IPO's, arbitrage, tuxedo banquets for his strategic clients, and endless lonely dinners at his kitchen table, into a nightmare without end. His all-but-estranged brother, Conrad, has blown into San Francisco, to honor Nick with a birthday present: a birthday present that will send his life careening around corners, down dark alleys, dropping from light poles into garbage dumpsters, a trip through the streets of San Francisco with an insane cab driver, and into the life of a beautiful and mysterious girl that calls herself ""Christine"". Or....is it the other way around ? Van Orton's 48th birthday is just two days away, and his dignified and too-quiet life is unraveling before his eyes. After a shattering visit with Christine, he finds that six hundred million dollars seems to missing from a special Swiss account. Is Christine the "" X factor "" ? Things, strange things, are happening to him, that seem to surround an enigma known as CRS: Consumer Rec- reation Services. Michael Douglas (TRAFFIC), Sean Penn ( MYSTIC RIVER), Deborah Kara Unger, Carroll Baker, and Armin Mueller-Stahl (THE MUSIC BOX)( are all imbedded in this mystery turned inside-out. Once you've started this picture, like Nick Van Orton, you'll be swept up in it, and you'll know that there's no going back. Director David Fincher ( ALIEN 3) expertly plants seeds of paranoia, chaos, dread, and the feeling that someone is turning reality into a drama about a man whose life is becoming a study of the bizarre. But...don't ask what's the object of the game....Finding out the object of the game, is, the object of the game. Chaos, like gold and silver, is where you find it. And you'll find plenty in ""The Game"". Even Daniel Schorr, the newscaster, is in on the action. If I were you, I wouldn't blink, after the credits roll... And...thank you for choosing...C. R. S. H.

"B002H09I0Y",2012-12-10,"David Fincher manages to take this story and screenplay (John Brancato & Michael Ferris) and makes it almost believable. The film is a mash-up between Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" and Philip K. Dick's ""Total Recall."" Michael Douglas is very good in the Scrooge-like role of Nicholas Van Orton, a high powered San Francisco investment banker. He's very wealthy, probably in the top 1/2%, let alone 1%. He's also very lonely and seemingly unhappy. As a surprise, his gadfly, devil-may-care younger brother, Conrad (Sean Penn) shows up and gives him a gift certificate for his 48th birthday. It requires Nicholas to show up for a series of interviews which allows a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) to design a ""game"" for him. You know, it's for the man who has everything. When Nick gets a phone call advising him CRS won't be able to work with him, he thinks nothing of it. What he doesn't know is that the game has just begun. Like Douglas Quaid in ""Total Recall,"" Nick isn't quite sure what is going on. He is put in physical, financial and mental danger. The film is beautifully shot and has surprise after surprise. Eventually Nick and the rest of us catch on. But what is real and what is part of the game, is sometimes hard to discern. The story tends to jump-the-shark in the final act which left me shaking my head. Still, ""The Game"" is a well-made film with some solid acting, great sets and photography and an invigorating score by Howard Shore. The Criterion version is certainly a significant upgrade from the DVD in terms of picture and sound.","",5,NA,4,"R1N277EXKRHV3B","3 1/2 stars for David Fincher's follow-up to ""Se7en""","M.

"B002H09I0Y",2012-08-23,"Michael Douglas accepts an invitation to join a mysterious exclusive ""recreation activity"" at the insistence of his loser brother, and is then thoroughly terrorized by the game makers. It's a mile-a-minute barrel ride over the edge of a waterfall, with the audience left in the dark right alongside the protagonist. Young director David Fincher plays up the suspense gorgeously, but isn't quite able to compensate for a few inherent flaws with the premise. First and foremost is Douglas's leading part, a thoroughly unlikeable one-percenter who's such a Scrooge it's impossible to grow too invested in his fate. In a way it's cathartic to see him tormented by such a brutal series of twists and turns, especially in the afterglow of the Wall Street bailout, but the film goes out of its way to paint him as a sort of tragic hero. The plot's reckless yanks on the steering wheel, too, aren't all they're cracked up to be. Those constant swerves provide a great series of unpredictable thrills, but ultimately ring hollow when our suspension of disbelief is nudged too far beyond the coincidental. The entire closing sequence, in particular, is just so dependent on things happening in precisely the right place, at precisely the right time, in precisely the right way, that it left me questioning the validity of everything that had come before. A nice effort, and a strong-legged concept, that falls short in too many important areas to deserve high marks.","",2,NA,3,"R1JKV8F51T7O3I","Fincher's Tremendous Knack for Suspense is Betrayed by a Cadre of Loose Screws","drqshadow","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2012",2012,"August","Thursday","2012/08","Q3",2012 Q3,"the United States"

In order for the Game to be a thriller, there would have to be genuine thrills instead of jaw-droppingly pallid scenes involving Douglas plunging to near-certain death only to ""miraculously"" survive. Apparently, the filmmaker has mistaken roller-coaster ride style shocks for thrills of a psychological bent.

"B002H09I0Y",2012-04-06,"I definitely enjoyed this movie. The concept of what to give someone who has everything for their birthday is intriguing. You give them nothing, or at least the experience of nothing. I took in this movie with a pair of studio headphones with some good enhancements and didn't miss a single line just in case people wondered if ""I actually watched the movie"". Yes, it all worked out in the end, but to be honest, I probably would not have taken the conclusion as well if this experience happened to me personally. I would have been filled with wrath that someone would manipulate my emotions like that by making me believe I killed someone close to me regardless of their intentions. I definitely would not be partying until I could recover my sanity. That is really the only thing about this movie is how quickly Nick regains his composure after the conclusion. It just didn't seem realistic. I think a tad more drama between him and his bro via a shouting match a la ""How could you do this to me?"" with everyone looking on in awe should have ensued and maybe tearful verbal explanation bringing up issues from the past that may have affected their present before the big hug would have made it seem a bit more real to me. However, time is money and they were already over the 2 hour mark so I guess it was a good place to cut the tape.

"B002H09I0Y",2012-02-21,"I will get out in the open that I consider David Fincher one of the freshest and more mature voices of this generation of film directors. He is a marvelous storyteller and he understands how to mesh style with substance in remarkable ways. Sadly, `The Game' is easily his weakest effort. Really, `The Game' fails in areas outside of the direction, which is very well orchestrated despite the film's many limitations. The tension is amicable and reminds me a lower end De Palma film actually; a little copy-cattish and not at all original but effective for the most part. Michael Douglas is always adept to playing a self-absorbed business man, and he nails that side of character with ease, but he also grapples with the growing panic and eventual paranoia of his character very well. I'll admit, I was impressed, especially since I consider Douglas an actor of minimal range. The rest of the cast is slightly laughable. James Rebhorn is awful here and Sean Penn, while utilizing his youthful charisma, is a tad overdone in some scenes (his paranoid breakdown lacks real conviction) and Deborah Kara Unger is about as convincing as a two-by-four. I'll say that the film's biggest asset is easily the production designers who really worked great angles at making this an entrenched thriller. Those sets are outstanding. But really, the film's ultimate downfall is the ridiculous screenplay. The film is just a preposterous mess, and while suspension of disbelief is best used in film's like this, the pure ridiculous of the plot itself it just irritating. I thought that the initial concept seemed intriguing (the whole `hand someone a profound life experience in the form of a game they don't understand but have to play out') but the way in which the script fleshes itself is so full of plot holes and lapses in possibility that it is a complete mess.

Douglas of course seems to enjoy playing a seemingly unlikeable character in both films but in ""The Game"" he finds himself in a web of contradictions. Perhaps the unconventionality of the film turned off Douglas fans and they opted for the former but if you like your intellect and senses challenged, do check out this original film.

"B002H09I0Y",2011-05-22,"I believe 'Game' falls into the 'Action-Adventure' genre a genre which, very generally speaking, leaves me nonplussed because of multiple unlikelihoods or out-and-out impossibiities. On the other hand, 'Game' is well acted and scripted and held my attention from the beginning to the end. The Michael Douglas character--a highly successful and [to me] rather unlikeable millionaire --volunteers to play a real-life 'game' the rules and nature of which he doesn't understand. He is told by his brother and others that 'The Game' and its results, will really jazz up his constrained life. The implication, of course, is that his life will be 'improved.' 'The Game' involves multiple harrowing adventures bound to increase the paranoia titer in any normal human being. Implicit in the film, is that the Douglas-character's survival is always under close control of the Gramers. I don't see it that way. There are multiple incidents in which Douglas' behavior--and survival--is largely controlled by chance rather than the gamers. Add them up and Douglas should die or be physically destroyed not once, but multiple times. In a sense, however, this is fairly typical of Action-Adventure films. The final unlikelihood is that Douglas' life will be 'improved' by a succession of horrific events that could easily unmask a hidden psychosis, bare minimum. It is definitely difficult to understand how such events could improve anyone's life. More realistically, Douglas is obliged to pay real dollars for 'fun' that would necessarily have cost millions. Like I said, it is difficult to see how this would have improved his or anyone else's life.","",0,NA,4,"R2VIEOG24FI858","Smashed","Mondo","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2011",2011,"May","Sunday","2011/05","Q2",2011 Q2,"the United States"

"B002H09I0Y",2010-11-30,"If you're looking for an unpredictable thriller movie, you'll probably like ""The Game"". It's well acted, and it will keep you at the edge of your seat wanting to know what the ending will be. The main character may even resemble someone you know. Nicholas (played by Michael Douglas) is sort of a boring but rich, middle-aged man who feels himself to be superior to his wild and less stable brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn). As a birthday gift, Conrad gets Nicholas a chance to play ""The Game"", in hopes that it will change Nicholas's life for the better. Throughout the film, you are taken on a suspenseful and rather violent adventure. When you reach the end, however, you find out the twist, and it is rather disappointing considering all the blood, sweat, and tears Nicholas had to go through to play the ""game"". I understand that Conrad was hoping the ""game"" would enrich his brother, but he could have done that without threatening the safety of his life. Sure, this is just a movie, so it's okay that the ending is unrealistic given everything that happened, but the movie still takes itself seriously in communicating that sometimes people need thrills to positively change their life. But frankly, I don't see how that would work if the thrills end your life rather than change it. There are other movies out there that more effectively express that one should cherish their life more.

"B002H09I0Y",2009-03-23,"Now apply heat to the canvas ... Some of the best storytelling, historically, starts off with a quick preface of sorts that gives some foreshadow or insight into something that's going to unfold in front of you in a very insidious way. Most of the time, the majority of observers and readers never see any of it coming. And that's always the point of it, too. In the case of `The Game', I think it's safe to say now that no one saw any of it coming and there was nothing predictable about what David Fincher was trying to pull off. Those that say something to the contrary are probably lying to save face. Those folks might also tell you that they saw Bruce Willis being dead in `The Six Sense', too. Don't get mad if I spoiled it for you with either film, it's been over a decade for both - you should've seen it. So what kind of a mind would even think to envision something as dark as CRS and all that follows? Fincher pulls out all the stops and beats the viewer with a stick from the first moment to the very end. And to his credit and not detriment, either. Fascination with the Godon Gecko archetype is about as timely now as any other time in history. I can see this film making a comeback of sorts either on cable or as a touchstone, with perhaps even a follow-up production to come. The question is: ""What binds us together?"" -- Money? Reputation? Class division? Gold-plated lifestyle? Family? Love? Death? Apathy? It's a very simple question that leads us down a dark road to a very complicated answer with Sean Penn screaming at us in frustration. It's almost like a dream, or a nightmare depending on how you see the world. The idea of tinkering with a person's framework of mortality and whittling away at it slowly is enough to send the most hardened minds into a state of panic. Dead parents, suicide, invasion of privacy, paranoia, blackmail, embezzlement and so on. Watching the master of controlled emotions have his most epiphanic meltdown may be one of the great silver screen performances of all time, just because the emotions are so well documented. Peel away everything, at your expense, and let's see what's left is really the knock-out blow. Every time I watch this film with someone, I always catch folks wiping their eyes because of the ending. This kind of emotional response is normal with this film and be prepared for several of them throughout. Critics often say the ending is cheap and creates problems with the storyline, but they're just upset at being forced into an emotional state. The film opened during dark days and was derailed during its scheduled release because of the death of Princess Diana. Anyone with a subscription to the Los Angeles Times archives can go back and read the articles that covered the demise of the film, which was well-documented. The film slipped through the theatres almost unnoticed and then vanished. The buzz was minimal but it did leave a lasting impression. I would bet more folks saw it on cable than anywhere else. People then talked about the idea of the film as something very novel and very original. IMDb message boards are full of requests from viewers to list other films that are like it. The lists are short. But several people through the millennia since have noted that John Fowles book `The Magus' is the unofficial originator. Having read the book, I don't believe it is, but there are similarities for sure and it's a very worthy and forgotten read to say the least. Masterpiece of film? Yeah. Overlooked? Yeah.

"B002H09I0Y",2009-03-04,"Reading some of the reviews here what seems missing is what I believe is the essential theme of this work --- personal transformation. Michael Douglas' character is trapped, or to be more precise stuck. He is stuck at a level of personal development (mean spirited, suspicious, cynical, isolated and alone --- he is an Investment Banker) in which he is intensely dissatisfied with himself and all around him. Though he does not realize it, he must move beyond his current ""self"" if he is to realize his full (though currently latent) potential as a human being. His brother - Sean Penn - realizes this and hence gives him a ""game"" for his birthday - since Penn the ""black sheep"" of the family had had a game given to him by some unnamed character and it had helped ""awaken"" him to a new self. The game is the necessary transformative vehicle for Douglas' character which forces a reassessment of himself and his outlook on life --- but only through a complete breakdown and displacement of his current self and his connection with the world that he had made --- and had in turn now trapped him. It is through the ensuing trauma and the culminating attempted suicide that allows him to emerge ""reborn"" and with a new outlook and new ""self"". Thus the climactic and happy ending with the well wishers at his birthday party in spite of the fact that a moment ago he had just ""murdered"" his brother and leapt to his ""death"". What this movie portrays is the classical mythological journey of trial and trauma where the old self is destroyed and a new self emerges like a beautiful butterfly from an ugly caterpillar.","",3,NA,5,"R217YDMFCMI9KL","A story of personal transformation","W.

"B002H09I0Y",2008-09-24,"Great movie! Most of the reviews indicate that most people see this as a movie about a man who plays a life-changing game given as a gift from a brother who also benefited from playing the game. I think it's really about a rich guy who never understood why his father committed suicide at the age of 48 and on his own 48th birthday he finds himself rich, but alone, miserable, depressed, and wondering how much he might be like his father, heading in the same direction (maybe toward suicide). His brother, knowing his rigid, responsible, analytical, and no-fun nature, and that he's miserable in spite of his wealth, tries to help him by giving him an unusual but life-changing gift, ""The Game"". The story is great fun to follow, but the climactic ending is about how the man is finally driven to the brink of sanity playing this game, and falls (jumps) from a building to end the torment. When he actually ends up safe and at the expected outcome of the game, he realizes it was all to teach him 2 things in such a dramatic way as to change his life: Finally, an understanding of why his father could be driven to suicide (since he was himself driven to it). And, that his wealth and life situation are tenuous, that he can now relax, not be so rigid and serious and begin to enjoy life again, before it's too late. His brother understood that, by giving him the game as a gift, how it would help him so profoundly, because his brother had a life-changing experience playing the game. We never find out how much the game cost the brother, but you figure it's gotta be, perhaps, millions. Don't try to pick the movie apart as being too unrealistic. Of course something like this is not meant to be real life. A movie doesn't have to be real to be thoroughly enjoyed. Sometimes, one's ability to let their imagination suspend reality briefly, also let's them thoroughly enjoy a movie like this. This is just a great story with a lesson.

"B002H09I0Y",2008-07-19,"Michael Douglas completely dominates ""The Game"", with nobody else, even Sean Penn, appearing in major minutes. He goes from the ""Greed is Good"" style investment banker, rich but alone, to a harried victim of ""The Game"", struggling to decide what is going on, and perhaps struggling for survival. Douglas' versatility is on solid display here, and he gets fine backup from the others. I watched this the day after Batman (""Dark Knight"") and enjoyed this one more, except for Heath Ledger as ""Joker"". The action moves more swiftly and the script is tighter than Batman's, played more around the edges, even though Batman films are also dark. The film's goal was achieved: I was confused and wondering whether the ""game"" had really become an elaborate con with theft and murder involved. My advice is to try ignoring the huge plot holes and implausibilities while watching. ""How could they do that?"" or ""How could they know Nicholas would do that?"" are fair questions, although not essential and not helpful. I don't know if the director is trying to claim our lives, even for a sophisticated person such as Nicholas, are so predictable. I would be depressed to experience a sequence of events such as these, where I was both easily controlled and easily anticipated, especially by people who didn't even know me before.

"B002H09I0Y",2008-04-24,"In the Game director David Fincher would introduce many of the same themes he would expand upon in his next film Fight Club. Both films tell the tale of wealthy but bored men who feel dead inside, they don't feel like they belong or have any connection with anyone. Both men decide that they need a life changing experience to shake them out of their apathy and get them to start living again. In the case of the Game that lost man is Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) a multimillionaire who oversees a publishing company. On his forty eight birthday he gets a mysterious gift from his younger and irresponsible brother Conrad (Sean Penn). The gift is actually a gift card to a shadowy company called CRS and Nicholas has his reservations. He happens upon their headquarters by chance and is subjected to a barrage of mental and physical tests before he is even accepted. One of my favorite character actors James Rebhorn plays the man behind CRS Dr. Feingold. All Feingold will tell an inquisitive Nicholas is "" Admit to yourself that it sounds interesting. We provide what is lacking in your life."" Soon Nicholas's game begins and he finds his life in danger almost immediately. This film which could also be a sort of precursor to the Saw films as well has no graphic violence the torture is all psychological. Nicholas is haunted by the memory of his father who killed himself on Nicholas's birthday over thirty years ago and the fact that he was Nicholas's age when he did it weighs heavy on his mind. He wonders how much of his father is in him. Conrad who has battled drug addiction will only tell Nicholas that he too has played the Game and that he has never felt better. "" They make your life fun again."" is what he tells his younger brother. Nicholas does get some help in the form of Kathleen (Deborah Kara Unger) a waitress he meets along the way and who may know more about the Game than she lets on to Nicholas. The film has a fantastic ominous mood enhanced by the cinematography of Harris Savides and especially a jangling piano score from Howard Shore. To reveal too much of what happens to Nicholas during his Game would take away from several scenes that play like a nightmare. I loved the acting and the feel of the film but had a problem with the ending. I didn't find it completely believable and a little too convenient. Still the film is very good and Douglas in the lead does an amazing job as he slowly begins to unravel. His whole world is turned upside down in the course of this film and his realization at the ending while not entirely believable is still well acted throughout.

"B002H09I0Y",2008-03-15,"THE GAME is another wonderful Michael Douglas film and I rate it at 5 stars. This film will really be appreciated by fans that enjoy dissecting a complex plot. The story, although hard to swallow and farfetched, was exceptionally engaging and kept my interest from start to finish. I thought on my first viewing that this film would have a sequel, but was proven wrong by events. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COULD RUIN ENJOYMENT OF THE PLOT: Nicholas Van Orton played by Michael Douglas is a wealthy banker, but a loner who even spends his birthday away from people. In the year of his 48th birthday (the age his father committed suicide and on the verge of classic mid-life crisis) his distant brother gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to unusual entertainment provided by something called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Giving in to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and all kinds of weird things start to happen to him. Prior to admitting him to participate he is required to take a series of mental and physical tests which were apparently run to determine his strengths, weaknesses, and perhaps map out some sort of efficient ""game plan"" tailored just for him. One statement I remember CRS telling him is that if you don't go to THE GAME, it will come to you. He receives a phone call telling him that he failed the tests and is rejected by the organization. He forgets about CRS, but then overhears several people talking about ""the game"" and what life-changing opportunities it provides. He notices several such ""loud"" conversations in public, and goes to the trouble of introducing himself and speaking with a couple of apparently new members of his private club. All they will tell him is they wish they were just starting ""the game"" and one man quotes the bible saying ""where I was once blind I now can see"". Once he is certain he has actually been admitted to THE GAME, he tries to return to the offices of CRS where he received his tests, only to find that no signs of their facilities remain and for all effects, this organization never even ""existed"". This initially ""mild"" form of harassment (i.e., being misinformed of his membership status, having drinks spilled on him in restaurants, strange people banging into him, folks behaving very strangely in rest rooms and other public places, empty toilets overflowing, his attaché case jamming at important business meetings, the pen CRS told him to keep leaking on his shirt, individuals collapsing in the street at his feet, etc.), gradually transitions to increasingly overt and often potentially life-threatening experiences which slowly work on his mental condition. All the more strange is the fact that he is provided the means of barely escaping his next experience by receiving an item or remembering a fact he learned during a prior event. Some examples of these increasingly life threatening events include: his estate being broken into and ransacked, being stranded in a darkened elevator, his cab driver driving his CRS taxi into the river almost drowning him, large crowds of people disappearing in a coordinated way from public places, being drugged, attacked by hooded gun men emerging from a large van marked Cable Repair Services, abducted and ultimately waking up in a crypt and stranded without cash, credit cards or passport in Mexico). The mental harassment is designed at first to merely embarrass or make uncomfortable, mildly inconvenience, then to be serious and painful, and after enough repetition and conditioning for him to associate these strange events, to effectively torture and eventually drive insane. Since almost every detail is staged redundantly there are no correct decisions left for him to make, and no avoiding the sequence of painful situations. He is ultimately like a caged animal walking wall to wall in a classic avoidance-avoidance conflict leading to insanity. The issue of the cost-effectiveness of this game plan is something the film never addresses, but we are too engrossed to think about this during the movie. One thing is certain, these people do not want to publicly kill him or leave any permanent record of injury due to anything other than a random event. The purpose of THE GAME seems not to be simple murder, but to professionally destroy, discredit and cause a very gradual physical and mental breakdown which will result in his being either jailed because of acting out displaced aggressions, hospitalized or institutionalized where he can ""die"" or be subjected to something while well out of public scrutiny. In his former professional life he could certainly have made enemies, and what better means could they use to destroy him with impunity? While his financial and mental conditions still enable him to investigate CRS, he believes he acquires ""evidence"" that one of the office workers at CRS was a hired professional actor, more likely to have been provided by Actors Equity than some private detective or intelligence agency (CIA?). As the story unfolds this evidence was probably ""fed"" to him as part of the plot which is just full of strange twists and complications, all leading him no place. His entire personality changes as he undergoes transformation from a strong business-world predator to the cowering subject of physical and mental harassment. It is sad but interesting to watch his gradual disintegration as forces outside of his control consume him. The ending was a bit strange and is the reason I thought there would be a sequel. IF THE ABOVE MATERIAL CAN RUIN THE ENDING THE FOLLOWING IS WORSE: The film can only be said to have a rediculous ending when Van Orton confronts his brother who he now believes is in on the game plan on the roof of the CRS building. At the end of the story after Van Orton believes he has shot his brother he actually jumps off the roof of the high rise CRS building intent on suicide because of his grief. He is surprised to learn after smashing through the break away glass of a fake skylight, that he safely lands on a huge airbag carefully placed to break his tremendous fall. He then sees his resurrected brother and all the other people dressed up in black tie to celebrate his birthday. It was, after all, just a ""harmless"" gag. At the end of the story there are no hard feelings and all gracious smiles as he is presented with the check for the elaborate hoaxes that CRS has staged for his ""entertainment"". Even though he has probably aged over 30 years as a result of continuous mental trauma in just a number of days, he goes from table to table thanking the guests for making it a very special party. He even asks out the very beautiful and treacherous lady who slipped him a mickey during the ordeal. Well, the film was too entertaining for that very weak and silly ending to ruin it, but it did erode what I thought was (up until then) a very well done and thought out thriller.","",4,NA,5,"R3I8854F3FOD5E","THE GAME-This couldn't happen in real life, could it?","Keith Mirenberg","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2008",2008,"March","Saturday","2008/03","Q1",2008 Q1,"the United States"

So I was one of the few that actually caught it in the theatre and actually loved it. (One of the few films that lives up to a great trailer). So for the HD version. I have to agree with most of the BAD HD reviews. This is a total ""embarrassment"" on the part of Universal for releasing such an obviously, un-remastered version of it in HD. You actually can tell there is a slight difference on a 56"" HD screen but for smaller TV's, I can imagine there is almost no gain at all in quality over the standard dvd (which was an earlier generation transfer to begin with). This is such a shame because this film along with a lot of Fincher's other ""dark"" (actual film quality vs. content) films deserve better treatment. Do not waste your money thinking it will look better because it's on HD-DVD. We'll have to wait for it to get remastered which does not look good at this point. I doubt Universal will follow Sony's suit in remastering, like the fifth element after bad bluray reviews. Universal chose HD-DVD because it's cheaper to produce so they probably won't listen to consumer's reviews on horrible transfers.

His brother, played by Sean Penn, has enrolled him in ""The Game,"" an experiential set of circumstances that progressively take Mr. Van Orton from rigid control of his surroundings to sheer chaos. Michael Douglas is great as the rich, divorced, and lonely man, an investment banker, who... on his 48th birthday is haunted by the memories of a father who chose to commit suicide rather than confront life. As the game starts, the company called CRS, or Consumer Recreation Services, involves Nicholas Van Orton in a series of events that bring him from anxiety to paranoia, to the depth of depression, through fear, anger, violence, seduction, and action... lots of action. We are soon caught in the game, thrilled by the reality of what is happening to Van Orton, and horrified at the fact that everything around him appears to be so real. Van Orton's intelligence carries him through most of the impediments, but the apparent reality overwhelms him and at some point, he is simply out of control. Michael Douglas is awesome as he conveys a sense of dread... of sheer panic that kept us riveted on his every move.

Conrad is the wayward brother of control-freak Nicholas (Michael Douglas), a wealthy and aloof San Francisco investment banker whose 48th birthday is coming up. Conrad finally decides on a unique birthday present: a gift certificate to ""Consumer Recreation Services"" (or ""CRS""). The service provided by CRS is a game. A friend of Nicks who has already ""played"" the game gives him a hint of what it's about by quoting a passage from the Bible: ""Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."" Once Nick officially signs up for the game a series of bad and bizarre things begin happening to him, things beyond his control and things designed to make him lose his high status. There is actually a double climatic ending that, in my case, I found emotionally satisfying. Michael Douglas does a good job of portraying the aloof investment banker whose life has suddenly spun out of control. Sean Penn who only appears in a few scenes makes the best of his limited screen time. The background music enhanced each scene. This movie was also well photographed. There are two major problems I found with this movie: First, it is far-fetched. This is supposed to be a game where everything is controlled. However, some of the things that happen to Nick are totally uncontrollable. Second, the movie is much to long. Because of its long length, it became tedious for me to watch. In my opinion, this movie could have been a half hour shorter and still presented an effective story. Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality. It has the movie in wide screen on one side and full screen on the other. There are minimal extras.

The Game follows a humorless business man, caught in the same kind of rut that had led his father before him to suicide, as he is ensnared in ""The Game""--an intense, real-life psychological thriller that threatens to become ""too real"" at any moment. In the same way that Total Recall always kept alive the question of ""what's really going on?"", The Game keeps twisting and turning, refusing to show its cards until the very last scene. It's fun to watch, so long as you don't ask yourself too many questions, because the plot is quite unrealistic if you're the sort to care about that kind of thing. The twisting and turning, the suspense, all of it is done well technically, but sometimes the story feels a little muted--a little ""going through the motions."" The flashback sequences, meant to feel arty and unsettling, don't really contribute much and feel slightly pretentious. It's as though this movie was overly conscious of what it was trying to be, and what it was trying to do, and so it came out feeling manufactured and artificial. It is done well, but not brilliantly so. So, The Game isn't realistic, and it's not brilliant, but if you have a few hours to spend, it will entertain you.

This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. The reason is that the things which happen to Van Orton (the banker played by Michael Douglas) have happened to me as well - in some way or another. Perhaps they have happened to you too. For example, you visit some company, and at your next visit - the company is gone. Or sometimes, you may experience that someone is draining your bank account without your knowledge. Or, a waitress splashes food and drinks on your suit. I definitely recommend this movie, because it is captivating to watch. For example, the house in which the banker Van Orton lives, is large and luxurious. It is nice to imagine yourself in the interior of this house. The ""waitress"" than ruins the banker's suit is very beautiful.

"B002H09I0Y",2006-01-01,"Director: David Fincher Cast: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, James Rebhorn, Peter Donat, Carroll Baker, Anna Katarina, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Charles Martinet. Running Time: 128 minutes Rated R for language, and for some violence and sexuality. Michael Douglas is on reliably good form as Nicholas Van Orton, a millionaire investment banker who lives in stately, joyless, isolated splendour in the mansion he inherited from his millionaire father. His father, Nicholas Van Orton Sr., died at 48 by hurling himself off the mansion's roof. Now having reached 48 himself, Nick, the man who has everything, is given an intriguing birthday gift by his rebellious younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn, sadly under-utilized here): an invitation to participate in a 'game' staged by the mysterious Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Their games involve the individual participant in a seemingly real-life scenario which blurs the edges between fact and fantasy, and which is deliberately tailored to suit each participant's personality. Reluctantly Nick signs up, as much out of boredom as anything else. It seems that for CRS, Nick's highly charged but emotionally austere and control-freakish personality calls for a high octane adventure in which he risks losing all control of events, and will thus be forced to depend on others for his physical, if not his psychological, salvation. And so the game begins. Nick soon comes to doubt that he is playing any kind of game. Has he instead become the latest victim of a monumentally sophisticated scam? Or is it all a bad dream? Throughout this is all very gripping, and being a David Fincher (""Seven"") film it has a dark atmospheric gloss which keeps you unpleasantly hooked; however, as the plot unfolds like a Chinese puzzle, the film gradually reveals itself to be pure surface. Despite Douglas essaying yet another hard-nosed anti-heroic establishment outsider with characteristic intensity, there is only an intermittent sense that Nick is in psychological rather than physical danger, even though this, underlined by the constant home-movie flashbacks to Van Orton Senior's demise, seems to be what's actually at stake. The lack of psychological menace in the film hinges on the fact that no other character in the film is properly developed, so no one really seems to carry any real threat. Perhaps the real threat to Nick is within himself, his own demons, which somehow the game is intended to help him exorcize. But it's questionable that this is what we actually see portrayed. The film is boistered by superb performances, including Douglas' best since ""Wall Street"". Deborah Kara Unger impresses as Christine, the waitress (or is she a waitress?), while Sean Penn is quite good at playing the somewhat spoiled and mouthy little brother. The script has wickedly funny dialogue and gives the film a slight ""black comedy"" feel. As usual in a Fincher film, the cinematography is dark and forebodding and creates a noir atmosphere of sorts. Howard Shore's music is excellent: Instead of attacking us with bombastic chords, a sound as simple as a piano tinkling is used to make our hearts race. The plotting is ingenious and one plot twist after another is instigated until the film creates a spider-web of fear and paranoia that has us mind-boggled. The films themes of redemption and paranoia are followed through right to the end in an ending that some think is supremely contrived. Despite its pretentious packaging, the constant hints that we are watching a dark psychological thriller, a morality tale, 'The Game' turns out to be merely a well-executed action adventure that plays on the audience's paranoid fantasies, and it is to this end that Nicholas Van Orton seems ultimately to have been created by the film-makers.","",0,NA,3,"RRCZE0SMA61X7","The Game (1997)","The Tweeder","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2006",2006,"January","Sunday","2006/01","Q1",2006 Q1,"the United States"
"B002H09I0Y",2005-12-19,"Directed by David Fincher, 1997's ""The Game"" is a very cleverly constructed and engaging thriller, although the implausibility of the whole 'game' leaves one with such a ""give me a break"" taste in their mouth that it simply can't be hailed as a masterpiece. Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is an incredibly wealthy investment banker who seems to be incredibly miserable, partly because of the daily grind of his work, and also because he's divorced and basically lives alone. His brother Conrad (Sean Penn) is seemingly aware of this, and in attempt to 'spice things up' for Nick, tells him about a suspicious company he should call named CRS, i.e. Consumer Recreation Services. Conrad tells his brother he's called them before and that they gave him a life changing experience in his own right. Nick ultimately gives in to temptation, not really knowing what he's getting into, and before he knows it, the 'game' begins. On the positive side, the mostly dark cinematography of the movie is extremely fitting and effective, and with the construction of the script being as engagingly clever as it is, we don't get the first real inkling as to just how impossibly far-fetched it all is until about ¾ of the way into this 2+ hour film. And the movie's 'big climax' IS suspenseful and surprising, albeit ultimately outrageous, and the final scene amusingly provides one last macabre twist. The film is also a tour-de-force for Michael Douglas, who appears in every single scene. It really is intriguing to watch a painstakingly maintained control freak have the proverbial rugs pulled out from under him at every turn, and Douglas is perfect for the role--intense, yet natural, and capturing the various emotions of his character masterfully. Deborah Kara Unger's performance is also memorable--Douglas and she have an excellent on-screen chemistry. Sean Penn, on the other hand, strikes me as being considerably miscast, but he doesn't have that much screen time anyway. In the end, this is a better-than-average thriller. It's highly entertaining despite its extreme implausibility and the rather underwhelming & laughable ending.","",2,NA,4,"RTCXHKVQFS43R","an intriguing film, and definitely a nail-biter despite the implausibility","Missing Person","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2005",2005,"December","Monday","2005/12","Q4",2005 Q4,"the United States"
"B002H09I0Y",2005-12-02,"I can't help but harken back to Michael Douglas's terriffic portrayal as a stock market financier in Wall Street. His character in The Game is strikingly similar to Gordon Gecco, except the dissimilarity of the Game's Orton is that instead of truly enjoying the merits of massive money monkey malarchy, he seems only interested in attaining more of it at the cost of no personal life whatsoever. Douglas is again, his usual thriller great self. We see him at the true zenith of perfection in his attempts to discover the secrets of the corporation that set forth this intriguing but upsetting game which seems to be much more than the simplicity originally implied. Oh sure, we expect something special in his brother's gift, but we certainly dont expect to be so far on the edge of our seat that we are getting cramps in our butts just trying to stay there. What I truly loved about this movie is my own lack of ability to come to a true answer as to what was really going on. So often, it is within my and other's nature to try and be smart and figure out the intended ending, only to be found right and then slightly disappointed that the writer and director didn't go past our expectations. Not so with The Game. Game takes you so deep into this man's downward spiral while ""playing"" this deceptive game, figuring out it's true intent becomes second nature. By the end, your nerves are so shatterred from the journey, you feel like you've been right there with Van Orton experiencing every nuance of the events in reality yourself. Plus, the finale is truly magnificent, which I cannot spoil here. This movie is a true must for anyone who is a fan of movies that not only make you think, but defy the typical Hollywood thriller model.","",0,NA,5,"R16C0SL7HQ5Q8L","Gordon Gecco gets hit by a truck","David M.

Much like the best games.At a superficial level, a psychological thriller, but as is usual with Fincher's films, it goes way beyond that. 'Alien 3' did much the same for me. At first viewing I was deeply underwhelmed. This was as in part due to James Cameron's phenonomenal 'Alien's', as it was to Fincher's unique cinematic style. His style again came to the fore in 'Panic Room', his film after 'The Game.' However the cause for initial lack of love for the film, again probably is due to his previous masterpiece, 'Seven'. 'The Game' does take some getting into, but on repeated viewing has the capacity to reward viewers, not only with superlative acting perfomances, but a great script and a pace that is deliberately slow enough to make the viewer share Michael Douglas' sense of torment and unease at where his 'game' is all going.

"B002H09I0Y",2005-04-20,"One of Michael Douglas's least appreciated films, The Game is an intriguing movie dripping with suspense. With an intensity which few films can rival, The Game quickly moves from one surprising scene to the next, always catching its audience off guard and creating a thrilling, edge-of-your-seat atmosphere. If you haven't seen The Game, you have no idea what you've been missing... Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is an extremely wealthy San Francisco banker, living in an opulent estate just outside of the city. But Nicholas is not a happy man. He generally spends his time alone, the exception being when he spends time with his clients brokering lucrative business deals. Nicholas even spends his birthday alone, and on his forty-eighth birthday, Nicholas is forced to reflect on the fact that his father committed suicide at the same age. But this year, Nicholas's birthday takes an unexpected twist when his estranged younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn) arrives unannounced at the Van Orton estate. A former drug addict involved in all sorts of nefarious schemes in the past, Nicholas remains skeptical of the true reasons for his brother's return. However, Conrad soon manages to convince Nicholas that his only reason for returning is to give his lonely, boring brother a birthday present he'll never forget. What exactly is the gift? It's a very expensive entertainment package provided by a firm called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Curious as to what sort of entertainment they provide, Nicholas visits CRS where he undergoes a series of mental, physical, and psychological tests to make sure he can handle what they offer. In return, CRS agrees to customize the adventure of a lifetime for Nicholas - as they do for famous and wealthy executives all over the globe... But when strange things start to take place and those are followed by seemingly horrendous events, Nicholas must make use of his intellect and his instincts in order to survive. Afraid the events are part of a misguiding sense of humor on the part of the employees at CRS, Nicholas arrives at their office building prepared to cancel the entertainment package. But to his dismay, the office space is vacant and the landlord has never heard of CRS. Even worse, Nicholas finds out that every financial account he owns has been wiped clean and that a criminal organization has been pulling similar heists on wealthy industrialists all over the world. Uncertain of his future, Nicholas sets out to get to the bottom of the truth, and in doing so, he finds out the truth about himself... Far from a blockbuster commercial success when it was first released in 1997, The Game is an unknown entity among most casual movie watchers. As such, those who stumble upon The Game will be duly impressed with the quality of this cinematic gem. Featuring two show-stopping performances by Michael Douglas and Sean Penn, The Game is an instant fan favorite among those who've seen it.

"B002H09I0Y",2004-08-09,"David Fincher's 1997 suspense-thriller regarding an obsessive man's (Michael Douglas) efforts at escaping the threats of an out-of-control entertainment/service firm. The film's momentum is based entirely on mystery; the suspense building up with each of the main character's unexplainable predicaments which seem to have no rhyme or reason. Although the story is well crafted with plenty of mystery, this is the sort of film you can only see once because the mystery is completely resolved in the end and leaves no surprises. Michael Douglas is a wealthy executive whose life is plagued by the vivid memories of his father's suicide. The tragedy has left him a control freak whose relations with his family and friends are strained at best. His brother (Sean Penn) invites him to play an undefined game offered by Consumer Recreation Services, a service firm. Michael Douglas' character soon finds himself entangled in a bizzare criminal scheme that he cannot fathom. How will he get out of this nightmare? Again, this is a great suspense-thriller to watch only once. All of the dangling questions are resolved at the end of the film thereby removing any suspense upon the second viewing.

But Van Orton will have to get rid of all that he previously stood for and accept to lose himself in the unknown. While some viewers have objected to the film's outrageous events and progression, this is precisely what draws me to it: its willingness to dispense with 'believable' developments makes Van Orton's quest all the more powerful. The movie could have been subtitled 'The initiation of a millionaire', because Van Orton undergoes numerous archetypal trials: he is stuck in a car underwater (in the belly of the monster); he is buried alive; his descensus ad infernos is such that he (literally) has to make a death-defying jump in a garbage dump; he has to find his way through mazes and use secret keys; most scenes take place in darkness.

"B002H09I0Y",2004-03-07,"Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, a not very likeable, rather unscrupulous bigshot investment banker (with echoes of the character he played in `Wall Street'). His troubled brother Conrad (Sean Penn) offers him as birthday present, a chance to play the `Game' on offer from an outfit calling itself `Consumer Recreation Services'. Intrigued but so far not very impressed, Van Orton visits the CRS offices and is subjected to several hours of psychometric testing. Then odd stuff starts to happen. A toy clown turns up in front of his house with a key in its mouth. A newsreader on TV breaks off reading the news and engages him in conversation. A man collapes in the street and when Van Orton helps he is taken along in the ambulance to..., well, somewhere quite frightening that is certainly not a hospital. This is the movie David Fincher made in between `Seven' and `Fight Club'. Like `Fight Club' it's a very interesting movie that fails to live up to the promise suggested by `Seven'. In fact it is like `Fight Club' in other ways too. Like `Fight Club' it starts out well, with a really interesting first half. Here we are set up with a delightfully intriguing mystery: here is Van Orton caught up in this utterly baffling nightmare; what on earth is going on? Are these guys out to destroy him? If so why? And why go about it in such a perversely elaborate way? And if not, what on earth are they doing? But, exactly as with `Fight Club' a really satisfying first half is followed by a really silly second half. The movie just tries to be too clever, and slowly starts to disappear up its own backside. Then, having got us all excited with a lovely intriguing mystery, it cops out with the most feeble and unconvincing of denouements. So after one hour, you are sat there thinking, ""Hey, what an interesting, fresh, original movie""; but after two and a bit, as the credits roll, you are sat there thinking: ""How disappointing, all a bit silly, hopelessly unbelievable and a serious letdown after first hour.""","",10,NA,3,"R2DNUP2QBWGPUY","Intrigues but Ultimately Disappoints","snalen","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2004",2004,"March","Sunday","2004/03","Q1",2004 Q1,"the United States"

Stated simply, his life is essentially a boring repetition of getting up in the morning, eating breakfast in the kitchen with Elsa, his housekeeper, portrayed by Carol Baker, and going to work.....Enter his brother 'Connie', portrayed by Sean Penn, who introduces him to 'CRS'.....as a birthday gift....He is at home one night and decides that perhaps watching the stock market report is not challenging him anymore so the next day he heads to CRS.... The first thing I noted was despite his retrained personality, he allowed a group of people who he only knew as ""CRS"" to take him apart, psychologically and physically (they did allot of testing e.g. treadmill etc.)....he allowed this to happen even tho he could not find out what was the essence of 'the game'....I am adventurous but NOT to the point where I would allow that to happen....frankly find it hard to believe that an investment banker would just accept this kind of thing. His adventures, as he gets further and further into 'the game', are what intrigued me. I will not state what the end was like because I feel it rude to do that.....However, I will say that it was refreshing to watch this all unfold.....

"B002H09I0Y",2004-02-19,"Having read about 60 of the reviews for this film, I can't believe no-one has offered the opinion that this film is basically a religious allegory - a sinner, whose disdain for other people shows in his attitude to his ex-wife, and brother - has taken away from him all that he possesses (or is possessed by). He is restored, redeemed if you will, by the mysterious operations of CRS. It seems fairly obvious. Looked at like this, the plot and the ending (which seem to have outraged so many of the reviewers) don't call so much for a suspension of disbelief as a willingness to participate in the symbolic coherence of the allegory. I'm not a Christian, but I can admire the courage of a film that dares to push the narrative so far, and in such a direction. Douglas is excellent as the central character hardly trying at all not to repeat the ""fall"" of his father (until CRS comes along), while Penn, to his enormous credit, makes a credible brother. Unger I like to think of as the presiding angel of the film, one who appears as a nuisance to Douglas, but leads him eventually through the shadows - and she does very well too. One other thing - the score, by Howard Shore, is terrifically simple, plangent and tense by turns; the film would not please so much without it.","",9,NA,4,"R3NEI4WS325ED8","Does the plot matter?","Paul Crossley","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2004",2004,"February","Thursday","2004/02","Q1",2004 Q1,"the United States"
"B002H09I0Y",2004-02-08,"""The Game"" stars Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy San Francisco investment banker staidly running his financial empire. Nichola's estranged ne'er-do-well brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn) presents a birthday gift to 48-year-old Nicholas -- a paid membership to The Game. The Game is a chaotic intervention -- Murphy's Law applied proactively. Suddenly Nicholas' controlling lifestyle is flooded with annoyances and emergencies including embarrassing restaurant accidents, police encounters, questionable meetings in hotel rooms, armed mercenaries and a taxi ride off a pier into San Francisco Bay. Friends and associates become suspect as The Game drives Nicholas towards financial and personal ruin. Michael Douglas portrays powerful men well and his performance is excellent. And ""The Game"" portrays chaotic ruination effectively. But the 1997 plot of ""The Game"" is not original. Dan Ackroyd's film ""Trading Places"" included a comedic rendition of The Game. And the television series ""Mission Impossible"" starring Peter Graves, Martin Land au and Greg Morris had a similar theme -- use chaos to weaken and destroy targeted individuals. IMO the similarity between ""The Game"" and ""Mission Impossible"" suggests an interesting speculation: 'How did the Mission Impossible team stay sharp between Government missions?'","",2,NA,4,"R1IMK7U5LB08G0","We Provide Whatever's Lacking ...","Richard Ballard","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2004",2004,"February","Sunday","2004/02","Q1",2004 Q1,"the United States"
"B002H09I0Y",2003-12-25,"David Fincher, the director behind Se7en and Fight Club, makes an extravagant suspenseful thriller with The Game. The noir-ish theme from Se7en remains, but this isn't a story about a crime being uncovered; only The Game is about a crime in the making (or is it?) Michael Douglas plays a successful rich businessman (an echo image of Gordon Gekko from Wall Street) who's haunted by his father's suicide. His life is typical; no adventures, just the same old, same old everyday. Things change when he recieves an unusual gift from his younger brother, played charmfully by Sean Penn. Nothing else should be said after this for I do not wish to ruin the plot if you haven't already seen it. But just to give you a glimpse, Michael Douglas' life turns very bumpy, dark, mysterious; in other words, it turns completely upside down in one of the worst nightmarish mind-boggling roller coaster trips any rich successful businessman stuck in a routine and haunted by his past could ever have!

"B002H09I0Y",2003-11-17,"THE GAME is definitely a director's movie. David Fincher (Seven, Panic Room, Fight Club) propels us into the nightmarish world of Michael Douglas' Scroogish investment banker. Nicholas is cold; lonely; bearing a lot of anguish over the suicide of his father, the seeming failure of his brother (Sean Penn in a rather small role, almost overacting, but tolerable). What in this movie is real and what is a game? The use of news commentator Daniel Schorr to set the rules for Douglas is very good, and unique. Deborah Kara Unger fills the role of Christine nicely, although sometimes she seems in a vague fog. Peter Donat as Douglas' lawyer is sturdy; James Rebhorn as the smarmy employee of CRS is also good. The movie rests on Douglas' shoulders and thought it may be a combination of his other roles, he still does a commendable job in carrying the movie. It is bizarre, nightmarish, ominous and a director's triumph. Some of the things that go on toward the end of the movie and stretch the credibility factor, but I can't divulge those without spoiling the ending.

"B002H09I0Y",2003-10-28,"Less than a full year before A PERFECT MURDER (1998) was released, Michael Douglas starred in THE GAME (1997), which is not simply a Michael Douglas movie, it's a David Fincher film-and you know what that means! From a screenplay by John D. Brancato & Michael Ferris, THE GAME is classic Fincher: dark, mysterious and with a constant sense of brooding danger in which lets you know that somehow, somewhere, something is not quite kosher. In THE GAME, Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton; a man of great wealth and power and totally devoid of any human compassion (as evidenced by the cold and callous way in which he fires a longtime employee). If this sounds like Gordon Gekko to you, it's because Michael Douglas, at this stage in his career, plays cold callousness like no one else. Call it typecasting; I call it brilliant acting ability and being smart enough to stick with what works. However, Gordon Gekko in the legendary Oliver Stone-directed WALL STREET (1987) didn't have a younger brother; Nicholas Van Orton does. On Nick's 48th birthday (the same age at which his father died, hint hint), his black-sheep-of-the-family brother Conrad, as brilliantly played by Sean Penn, visits him in his sprawling, cherry-wood office and hands his older sibling his birthday present: a business card with the name Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) on it. ""What is this,"" Nicholas cynically asks. The sly answer given by Penn is one of my favorite lines in the film, and one that tells us that his elder bro's life will never be the same, once he begins to play THE GAME. Along the way, Nicholas Van Orton encounters CRS and its primary spokesman (or so he thinks) Jim Feingold (played with disarming confidence by character actor James Rebhorn), a mouthy cocktail waitress (Deborah Kara Unger) who seems to hold the secret to THE GAME, and a spooky-looking full-size inanimate clown who appears to watch everything he does. Also along the way are near-brushes with death that culminate with Conrad Van Orton's tearful admission that he ""didn't know what the $#@! he had gotten them into"" when he had signed his brother up for THE GAME. But that's still just the beginning... Everyone is superbly cast in this film, including BABY DOLL (1956) herself, Carroll Baker, and the always-watchable Armin Mueller-Stahl. But the real star here is David Fincher; he is so adept at guiding us down a labyrinthic path of which only he knows the end, that all we can do is hang on and enjoy the rollercoaster ride on which he breathlessly takes us. He primarily relies on small, subtle signs of foreboding to generate suspense, as opposed to full-blown violence and gore. Although this is one of those films that relies on first-time viewers' lack of knowledge of what to expect, and thusly loses something on repeated viewings, it is still a very good film to re-visit on occasion, if only to experience Fincher's unique style (this film and A PERFECT MURDER are miles apart in this respect, believe me), Douglas and Penn's acting and the production values, which are first-rate. See and experience THE GAME for yourself. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","",5,NA,4,"R35P46R7C1POW9","Gordon Gekko gets his comeuppance--big time!!!","Robert J.

"B002H09I0Y",2003-08-07,"I'm not sure which film most of the other reviewers below have seen, but this clunker easily earns its reputation as David Fincher's ""bad"" movie. Where ""Fight Club,"" ""Se7en,"" and even ""Panic Room"" were all more or less successful in portraying engaging characters, setting convincing moods, and effortlessly bringing the viewer along with the narrative (all signs of a truly great director), ""The Game"" lamely prods us through just over two sadistic hours of largely predictable plot points. I've heard others claim that this film references ""The Trial"" or the story of Job somehow, but this story is fully spiritually removed from either of these sources--especially given the unbearably treacly ending. It probably wasn't Fincher's fault -- it appears that he just got caught up in what he thought to be, at the time, a really revolutionary script -- so I'm willing to forgive him this one. (No surprise, incidentally, that this is the only one of his DVDs without commentary or other features.) The actors nearly rescue the situation, although not too well. Douglas warms over a chilly re-hash of ""Wall Street""'s Gordon Gekko just for the occasion, Sean Penn embarrasses himself in every scene right up to the horrible denouement and ""surprise"" finale, and Michelle Unger... well, she looks nice. Which was enough to merit a star more than I thought this deserved. In short: if ""The Matrix"" totally blew your mind, this will too.

"B002H09I0Y",2003-05-22,"What happens when you are a powerful multi-millionaire and have everything you ever wanted? While you and I might think this situation is highly desirable, for Nicholas Van Orton, played by Michael Douglas, it is very boring. In fact, you might say that Nicholas is miserable. However, Nicholas' brother Conrad Van Orton, played by Sean Penn, has bought Nicholas a gift for his 48th birthday, an invitation to play ""The Game."" From this point forward the movie drags for what seems forever. I was beginning to regret watching this movie. Looking back, though, I now know that this beginning helps us to more fully understand how boring and awful Nicholas's life is, and provides an excellent contrast with what happens later in the movie. Nicholas is in a very upscale restaurant when a waitress (Deborah Unger as Christine) spills wine on his shirt. Christine is fired by the restaurant manager and leaves, very upset. Before you can say white rabbit, a waiter rushes by Nicholas' table and drops off a note that tells Nicholas to follow the girl. Prepare for the roller coaster ride. Within moments Nicholas finds himself involved with an apparently dying man, then just as quickly he finds he is being chased by the police, and police dogs, and things just get worse and worse. The list of things to which Nicholas is subjected is too long to describe, and would leave you with no surprises. Nicholas tries to figure out how to make all the action and events to which he is being subjected stop. Nicholas can't handle the loss of control. Further, the chaos of his experiences seems to follow no pattern or order. Eventually Nicholas gets back to where he thinks it all began for a showdown that left me surprised and amazed. You'll have to watch the end for yourself. There are several lapses in credibility, but unless you are an obsessive control freak (sort of like Nicholas Van Orton, for instance) you'll likely consider the lapses minor. This movie ultimately is an intelligent thriller that relies on action only when necessary to heighten Nicholas' fears and to pull him into what seems like a deeply nefarious conspiracy. After watching, this movie became one of my favorites, and I've now seen it several times. The most difficult part of this movie is the relatively slow first part. However, have patience; what you learn in the first part helps you to understand Nicholas and to be drawn more fully into his situation. Sympathy with Nicholas and his situation is highly desirable to fully appreciate the end of the movie. I was sympathetic, and enjoyed this movie. 5 stars for an intelligent thriller that relies on intelligent plot versus guns, fast cars and special effects.

His roguish kid brother Conrad (Sean Penn) promises a fabulous 48th birthday present which might just bust him out: an invitation to play a mysterious game offered by Consumer Recreation Services, a company dedicated to entertaining the top end of town. Nicholas's life promptly disintegrates. Is it all part of the elaborate game, or has he become embroiled in something far more sinister? ""The Game"" not only plays with contemporary paranoia about upper-class, white-collar vulnerability to scams - it also neatly subverts audience expectations. By putting us in precisely the same position as Nicholas, the film doesn't let us solve the mystery before he does. Though Act 2 of the screenplay wanders, it's easily the best work yet from John Brancato and Michael Ferris (the team who also penned the hideous ""The Net""), and David Fincher elevates it enormously with his slick shooting style and trademark noirish unease. Douglas is great as the tormented conservative, harried into reclaiming his life, and Penn does wonders with his small but crucial role.

"B002H09I0Y",2001-11-30,"This is one interesting, thrilling film. It's definitley one of those films that you'll think about afterwards. Michael Douglas stars as a rich man(again?!), who is having his birthday. He's now at the age his father was when he comitted suicide. Sean Penn pops up as his brother, who offers him an interesting birthday present that needs him to play 'the game'. Before Michael knows it, the game is on and he doesn't know what's going on, what to do, or where to go. Along the way he hooks up with a waitress(Deborah Unger)who gets involved with him and this serious 'game'. There are twists and turns in this movie that are set up and executed very, very well. There are things that the audience won't expect. Douglas is very good when he gets to play icy millionaires. You can thank ""Wall Street"" for that. He is at his best here. Sean Penn does what he can with a pretty small role. Director David Fincher brings a moody, captivating presence to the film.

Not just material things, but his personal relationships--and even his life itself. Michael Douglas stars as Nicholas Van Orton, a divorced wealthy businessman who has acquired all the material wealth one could ever want, but something is lacking. Enter The Game. It is Nicholas's 48th birthday and his rebellious brother, played by Sean Penn, gives as a gift an invitation to play The Game. Nicholas is not informed of the rules of said game or even when it will start. He is told that it is sort of like a vacation only you don't go to it--it comes to you. He is thrown into a series of events which at the beginning he is slightly amused. But the stakes increase and when his world is so unpredictable and turned upside down and he thinks he's lost everything, he is convinced that this is no longer a game. It becomes a struggle for his very life. The ending is emotionally moving and it makes the viewer think about what is really important in life. Buy it. Rent it. See it at a friends house--whatever.

Nicholas Van Ortan (Michael Douglas) is a millionaire tycoon who resides in San Francisco. Soon it becomes obvious that Nick is not the perpetually contented man that the ideal millionaire is thought to be. He is in fact very dissatisfied and bored by life. On his birthday, he meets with one of his only remaining relatives, Conrad Van Ortan (Sean Penn), at a fancy restaurant. Conrad, Nick's brother, convinces him to spice up his life by calling the latest new corporation, known as Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Nick makes an appointment, in which an odd series of tests are conducted on him, taking up a total of 24 hours. CRS takes Douglas on a wild thrill ride of implausible, yet fantastic events, as the movie will for you. The Game's lack of realism does not lower its status in any way, as Nick finds himself in deserted hospitals, talking to inanimate objects, driving off piers, jumping off buildings, and much more, with the frequent, brief, and mysterious appearances of Conrad. The Game is sheer fun and excitement as well as a must-see movie for all action/adventure lovers.","",0,NA,5,"R3R3SMWHXWSQ9U","Deadly Entertainment","Ari Weiss","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2001",2001,"September","Saturday","2001/09","Q3",2001 Q3,"the United States"
"B002H09I0Y",2001-09-08,"What is a ""Propaganda Film?"" And what does it mean to boldly proclaim in an opening credit that this is a ""Propaganda Film?"" What is the Propaganda...what is the message? Is the message open and overt? Or is the message hidden and covert? And since so many films have messages and agendas and NEVER proclaim that fact but set about to influence attitudes and values, anyway...it's rather refreshing, if not startling, to see a film which tells you up front that it is ""up to something"" but then leaves it to you to figure out what it is up to. ""It is frustrating to me if you don't pay attention."" The lighting, clarity of imagery, and whole atmosphere of this film are rich in color and sharpness...and tone. The lighting and camera angles...and quality of the image in many scenes are pure Kubrick...the outer hall in the building where CRS is located is ""2001"" style...but the bar in Nicholas' club is right out of ""The Shining."" The use of sound is significant and interlocking with the visual imagery. When Nicholas sets out his birthday ""supper"" from the oven where Ilsa has left it...a sandwich, some fries, a chocolate cupcake with one small candle on it [how sad... how alone he is...]and he puts the wine glass down on the tray...the sound reminded me of the clinking of the glass by Dave Bowman in the ""hotel room"" at the end of ""2001"" just before he dies...and is reborn...as the Star Child. ""What does it profit a man if he gain the whole world -- and yet loses his soul?"" ""Truly, truly, I say to you...unless one is born again..."" Does Nicholas die symbolically in this film? Is he not even put in a casket? Is he reborn? Is he transformed? Is he dead to the old self...the old life...that was him? Does it have the power to reclaim him with its illusions and lures? ""No one has expressed an opinion about how it will affect the pampered existence of Nicholas Van Orton."" ""What does that matter to a bloated fat-cat millionaire like you?"" And what is the t.v. commentator [Daniel Schorr] talking about...he is talking about the economy... and how some companies don't want to give health insurance to their employees...and how 59% of the people believe that they will lose their jobs in the next 5 to 7 years. And what do we read in our nightly newspapers...or hear on t.v. ...if it is not mostly economic news and how the market is doing...and only a brief passing note that some company may have projected that it will not meet its earnings during the next quarter so it is going to lay off 5,000 people worldwide to cut costs. But do we hear anything of those 5,000 people and what their fate is after they lose their jobs...what devastation or disruption it is to their lives? Or do we just get interview after interview with CEO's and money managers trying to tell everyone how to be successful and get rich? Part of the illusion of this film is if you get caught up (particularly in the first viewing) in trying to make sense of the game...and trying to figure out who is doing these things...and how they are capable of pulling it all off so ""perfectly"" (as one reviewer commented) -- only God could know if Nicholas would step the right way or not...or jump the right distance or not. Perhaps the answer is that the game is not being administered by any human agents...but rather is an allegory for life itself...no one has life, in all of its aspects, under control either...we might like to think that we do, like Nicholas...and some of the reviewers who react so strongly and negatively to the film here. Does the film disturb their own illusions that they have life under control...and that life could not be a threat to them either? We have programmed illusions of safety and ""meaning"" and ""purpose"" for life...most of them very worldly and secular...but what happens when life starts going out of control? When Nicholas returns to his house and finds it vandalized...and that loud music of Jefferson Airplane singing about Alice [in Wonderland] ...or perhaps we should think of the ""The Wizard of Oz""...what if that harmless children's story full of violence and monsters and a supposed Wizard who ""has everything under control"" is also a hidden allegory...what if the Wizard is supposed to be a hidden stand-in for God...and what if there is no real Wizard behind the curtain? The problem comes here, of course, in that the messengers (the writers, directors, and producers of this film) suffer the taint of the message... for they are part of the system too. They are making money, too. Do they salve their consciences by believing that they are doing a ""good work"" for the salvation of their fellow man? And what of the ending of this film? Does Nicholas survive? Is the ending also a deception and an illusion?...what if Nicholas actually dies in the fall...and the rest is an ""after life"" ... or ""in flight"" fantasy...perhaps like ""Vertigo""... did the detective really survive the fall from the building at the start of that film...or is everything after that a ""death dream?"" What if the transition between life...and death...is a transition to a different plane of existence with no knowledge that one has actually died... but one is simply moving into another illusion of reality to replace the one that one has just left? Where does the soul go...when the body dies?

"B002H09I0Y",2001-09-02,"When watching ""The Game"" for the first time, one will be pleasantly surprised by the film's continuous twist and turns literally leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat. It's almost impossible to predict the outcome of this mystery/thriller, all the more so because of director David Fincher's penchant for draping his film with ominous shadows and uncomfortable flashbacks dealing with alienation and suicide. ""The Game"" does not feel like the kind of film headed anywhere near a comfortable resolution. And if one recalls Fincher's previous effort, the dark and thoroughly depressing ""Seven,"" you know he is a director uninhibited when it comes to detailing the demons which haunt his psyche. In ""The Game,"" rarely has the San Francisco locale seemed so dark and dreary. The rain-soaked streets, abandoned skyscrapers and lonely mansions are displayed in an almost gothic fashion, reminding one of the lonely fog-shrouded sets of early Hammer horror films. Drop into this desolate atmosphere the alienated and secluded protagonist played by Michael Douglas, and viewers find themselves in a most uncomfortable motion picture. The tension rarely lets up, as Sean Penn, who plays Douglas' kid brother, appears on the scene to offer a birthday present to his brother -- a game that will have a profound affect on his life. Douglas, out of boredom more than anything else, eventually visits the company which will offer ""The Game."" He soon discovers that the private and lonely existence he has forged has been violated with eerie mannequin clowns appearing in his driveway and television sets talking to him rather than reporting the stocks. Soon, nothing is what it seems, not even his relationship with his brother, and Douglas finds himself hunted by mysterious men and answering phone calls that play back conversations he's had previously. Throw into this tumultuous mix a wise-cracking waitress (played with silky ease by Deborah Unger) who becomes Douglas' ally, and the viewer is in for a halloween-like rollercoaster ride complete with runaway taxi cabs, blazing machine guns and chases through lonely alley ways. All of this frantic activity eventually leads to the top of a downtown office building, where Douglas is confronted with a desperate choice -- either accept ""The Game"" as just that, or realize his life is truly in danger, protecting himself at all costs. His decision may not surprise the viewer, but the resolution absolutely will. I'm not sure why I enjoy ""The Game"" so much, having seen it multiple times. Douglas' performance is fine, if not a bit derivative of his past work. Penn seems to enjoy himself in what is essentially a thankless cameo role. Unger, who steals many of her scenes, is appealing though nothing to write home about. Perhaps what sets ""The Game"" apart is its atmosphere, undoubtedly fueled by Fincher. This is a director's film if ever there was one, complete with frantic pace, symbolic flashbacks, strategic camera angles and already-mentioned dark vision. While the over-the-top intensity of Fincher's better known efforts ""Seven"" and ""The Fight Club"" is definitely in full bloom here, he does hold back just enough of those mischievous demons to make ""The Game"" his most mature and accessible effort. And thus, it is one of the finest works to date by one of the most interesting directors working today.","",2,NA,4,"R26NJRRA8EW1AV","A Thought-Provoking Thriller","Chris K.

"B002H09I0Y",2001-03-24,"I saw this movie when it first came out. Upon first viewing, I enjoyed it for several qualities. Director David Fincher provides a really creepy, eerie atmosphere to the story. The cinematography has a dark, eerie look (as in Seven). The music (such as the tinkering piano) has a way of creeping up on you. Michael Douglas is terrific, as usual. Towards the 2nd half however, I started to lose interest. I found the story was just cranking on and on with no point. By the end, I was dissappointed with the payoff. I felt it didn't have to go on so long to explain it's point. I guess this is the reason it didn't perform so well at the box office. The 2nd time I watched this was a different story. Knowing in advance about the ending, I could pay more attention to the meaning of all of the scenes (I don't want to give too much away). The early flashbacks are there to tell you what kind of unhappy, selfish, lonely person Douglas is like. As the movie progresses, you begin to see him changing as he is going through the game. This is the whole point of the story, not what is really going on. By the time the payoff has come around, you are touched with what has occured. The viewer is not really supposed to be surprised at the end, but emotionally moved. What I really would like to see someday is a DVD with Fincher's director's commentary. This is such a complex movie where each scene needs to be explained. I hope David Fincher does that someday (like the new Seven DVD). One minor note: For those of you complaining about how far fetched the movie is, this movie is supposed to be unreal. I could not believe one minute of it, but Fincher makes it clear he doesn't want you to believe in it.

"B002H09I0Y",2000-11-02,"Michael Douglas plays a wealthy investment banker named Nicholas Van Orton. He is callous and rude lacking ethics and morals. Except for power and money, Van Orton has little else: no wife, no children and no life outside of the banking business. For his 48th birthday, Van Orton's brother, Conrad (Sean Penn) buys him a ticket to ""The Game."" The game is a fictional attempt to destroy Van Orton's secure life of power and affluence. The adventure begins with Van Orton the multi-millionaire, and ends with Van Orton the pauper. ""The Game"" forces Van Orton to doubt and confuse fact with fiction, the real from the unreal. The viewer also faces the same dilemma constantly guessing whether he's watching a game or a real scenario. ""The Game"" reminds me of John Fowles' novel ""The Magus,"" except that the movie lacks magic and mysticism. The object of ""The Game"" (like ""The Magus"") is to force the involuntary pawn (Van Orton) to experience a catharsis; that is, to change from a callous and uncaring individual, to one of humane endeavors and compassion. The movie is partially successful. Van Orton is certainly ""changed"" by the game, but I doubt that he gives his millions to charity, and lives a life pursuing causes more noble than the buck.

When he's running from bullets through San Francisco, for instance, his enemies know that not a single neighbor will look out a window, come to his aid, shoot back, or even call the police. For god's sake, in one laughable moment he had to jump from a specific spot even though nothing keeps him from being several feet to either side.

The gift involves Nicholas signing up for a mysterious company which offers a `game', which in turn offers the participants a series of surprises that ""provides whatever is lacking"" in their lives. Though a rather pessimistic and somber individual Nicholas accepts in the hopes of escaping the memory of a solitary childhood and witnessing his father's suicide. When the surprises the `game' issues become seriously deadly Nicholas wants out. But this particular game offers no escape. Critique: Nerve-wracking, high wire act of a movie directed with guile precision by David Fincher (`Seven', `Alien 3'). So far all of David Fincher's films have been good which is rare for someone who has been dubbed as a purely commercial director. The sort of tagline that is a deathnail for anyone seeking true legitimacy in Hollywood. Michael Douglas is good in the role of another heartless tycoon type character in the mold of Gordon Gekko from `Wall Street'. Douglas gives the character just a slight insidious turn and taking him into Twilight Zone territory. It's also good seeing Sean Penn in a first rate mainstream movie for a change. Film is made in such a way that every detail has to be dissected in order to make a logical progression of events. Which otherwise would seem chaotic and purely coincidental. Towards the climax it all makes perfect sense and provides a most welcome escape ending. When the credits roll and you know it is truly over it is strangely satisfying and disappointing.

"B002H09I0Y",1999-02-02,"The Game is better than that. Written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris and directed by David Fincher, of the recent and creepy-Catholic inspired Seven, The Game is an entirely orthodox vision of a man who is forced - by his own choices - to his own breaking point, which is the only point that will release him from the trap his life has become. Without the religious jargon as its delimiters, The Game nevertheless powerfully portrays the entire human drama of sin, confession, penance, absolution, forgiveness, oh, and crucifixion and resurrection - all in just over two hours. The Game is equal parts Adam, Cain, Abel, Jonah and Lazarus all rolled into one of the most taught psychological thrillers that I've seen. Some of the film's most beautiful moments are the deft touches that seem incidental at first blush, but nevertheless point to the underlying allegory: first communion, a statuette of the Virgin Mary, a reference to the book of John, and not one, but two resurrection scenes unlike anything you've ever seen. If only Walker Percy were still alive! If writers Brancato and Ferris aren't Walker Percy fans I'll eat my foot. The author of The Moviegoer would recognize his ideas unmistakably by the film's exquisite rendering of a man so lost in the cosmos that he isn't even aware of his despair. The question that Walker Percy spent his entire life asking - How do you speak to a man sensibly about ultimate truth in a Christ-haunted and Christ-forgetting culture? -- is not only truthfully but beautifully answered by The Game. Nicholas Van Orton is the man who has everything, and thus values nothing. As an insanely successful control-freak investment banker who disdains all those who should be closest to him, Van Orton is at once, as Percy puts it, ""both the hero and ******* of the cosmos."" His wealth and power have sated him to the point of extreme boredom, and it is clear that all viable re-entry points have either already been attempted or are simply too base for a man of his stature. What are the conditions under which such a man could actually see the Parthenon and not be bored, or in this case, the Golden Gate Bridge? In Van Orton's case, it takes the work of Consumer Recreation Services, a gift that Van Orton receives from his younger brother for his 48th birthday -- the age at which his father before him (like another father and son in another Percy novel) has committed suicide. Van Orton is mildly amused by his brother's gift, and one day finds himself coincidentally in their new San Francisco office, so he decides to inquire. Here he meets an administrator named Feingold who tempts him into trying the game with the same logic that Satan used on Eve: first, admit that you're interested; it's a no-risk obligation. Van Orton then fills out a questionnaire that sounds more like a confessional transcription than an application to a recreational service: I sometimes hurt small animals, I feel guilty when masturbating, etc. But CRS might as well stand for Character Redemption Services, because the company and its omniscient database immediately begins pursuing Van Orton like some deranged hound of heaven on steroids, backing him up against the wall of his greeds, gluttonies and lusts for what reason neither we nor Van Orton know. Initially, Van Orton is intrigued by the attention; he smiles as he walks into the airport and realizes, with the shock of discovery, that every exchange, glance and action is imbued with tremendous potential significance. He is returned to that state of innocent childhood belief that around each corner the scene has been constructed just prior to his arrival and will collapse just after his departure. But he doesn't know how far it goes, where it starts and ends, and why. Like life, he is only armed with the one clue that the purpose of the game is to discover the purpose of the game. CRS gives Van Orton the full Job treatment: as his security, safety, and luxury are all pulled out from under him with astonishing speed, he is forced to confront the bankruptcy of his own soul and the fragility of his own life. What he doesn't know, and nor do we until the end, is that he has his own personal Beatrice guiding him through the underworld his life has become, and passively but definitively leading his action every misstep of the way. The waitress Christine is almost always with him, and there are little clues here and there, that she is in on it, such as when she mutters to herself, ""Watch out for boards and nails, there should be a fire escape"" as she leads Van Orton through the second floor of an abandoned building before jumping into the garbage cans in the alley below. One of the nice touches comes at the end when we learn that his guide's real name is not Christine, but Clare, who happens to be the patron saint of television, a perfect choice for a story so completely layered and selectively filtered. From the allegorical point of view, The Game's great strength is in its depiction of the relationship between free will and original sin. With CRS in place of God, Van Orton is placed into situations where by varying degrees he is or is not allowed to exercise his controlling tendencies. When Van Orton is least curious about CRS, they are casually there in the form of a bum asking for money or a toilet stall occupant whose run out of toilet paper. By the film's end, when Van Orton believes he has regained his control, he is actually playing as tightly and closely to the CRS script as is possible. The climactic scene has Van Orton discovering that this is his crime, and that he cannot actually have control. Facing the mirror of his own soul, Van Orton judges and condemns himself to death, choosing the inheritance of his father's and grandfather's death. In the most incredible scene of free-will-as-God's-destiny ever played, Van Orton jumps to his death and lands perfectly inside the circled X that CRS has scripted for his game. Van Orton falls, quite literally, of his own choosing, and lands squarely in the arms of his savior. After reviving him and checking for cuts, one of the medics says, ""It's always quite a fall."" At the film's conclusion, Feingold congratulates Van Orton saying, ""It's a good thing you jumped, because if you didn't I was supposed to push you."" Ultimately, The Game pulls off in allegory what the majority of modern cinema has failed to do convincingly or persuasively for as long as I've been alive. The Game, as one of the CRS decoys says to Van Orton early on, is all about John 9:25 - ""Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."" The Game delivers the old eternal truth in the wrappings of a new mystery. Without a single preachy cliche, without any embarrassment or camp, The Game forces Van Orton and the viewer to recognize the most fundamental paradox of the Christian faith: he who would save his life must first lose it.","",8,NA,5,"R2ILDIUBDN0XPZ","If you require redemption, this film's for you.","Lex Rex","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 1999",1999,"February","Tuesday","1999/02","Q1",1999 Q1,"the United States"

"B002H09I0Y",2020-07-19,"Ich bin großer David Fincher Fan und somit was es nur eine Frage der Zeit bis ich auch THE GAME sehen würde. Irgendwie war ich heute in Thriller-Laune und entsprechend war er dann an der Reihe. Für Fincher-Verhältnisse leicht unterdurchschnittlich aufgenommen und auch auf meinem Discord-Server eher für schwach befunden war ich von Anfang an etwas kritischer dem Film gegenüber eingestellt, was sich jedoch schnell lockerte. Mit der Zeit konnte, beziehungsweise kann, ich die Kritik am Film jedoch wirklich nachvollziehen, auch wenn ich das Ganze nicht ganz so eng sehe wie einige andere. Zuallererst sei gesagt, dass THE GAME durchweg unterhaltsam und kurzweilig, hier und da sogar wirklich spannend und mysteriös, daherkommt, was natürlich bereits ein großes Plus für einen Film ist. Immer wieder stellt sich die Frage danach, wem man eigentlich trauen kann und was eigentlich das Ziel des Spiels und damit auch CRS ist. Leider wird schon nach weniger als einer Stunde klar, dass man es bestenfalls mit einem soliden, wenn nicht sogar schwachen, Skript zu tun hat. Immer wieder fallen kleinere - oder größere - Logiklöcher auf, welche sich gerade hinten heraus häufen. Das wäre halb so wild, wäre das Ende nicht eine Art Kirsche auf der Sahnetorte mit dem Namen ""Facepalm"". Was einem hier als Lösung des Ganzen aufgetischt wird ist nichts weiter als faules Screenwriting und mit einem Blick auf die Profile der beiden Drehbuchautoren bewahrheitet sich der Verdacht: die beiden haben quasi nichts auf dem Kasten. Glücklicherweise ist Finchers Inszenierung gewohnt stark und rettet viele Szenen, wenn nicht sogar den ganzen Film. Ohne den Regisseur von SE7EN wäre THE GAME vermutlich ein Totalausfall geworden. Auch den Schauspielern ist es zu verdanken, dass THE GAME am Ende des Tages ein echt guter Film ist. Michael Douglas spielt wirklich gut und auch der Nebencast rundum Sean Penn und Deborah Kara Unger kann stets überzeugen. Leider fällt bei dem Figurendesign und der Charakterentwicklung abermals das mittelmäßige Skript auf, denn das Finale muss einem erklären, was genau eigentlich hier entwickelt wurde; zuvor jedenfalls wurde dies nicht gerade effizient und nachvollziehbar klar gemacht. Abseits von Douglas' Figur fällt THE GAME in dieser Kategorie so oder so abermals ziemlich dünn aus. Die Kameraarbeit ist stets auf einem hohen Niveau und bietet viele innovative und schön anzusehende Shots und auch der Schnitt kann durchweg überzeugen. Auch der Score hat mir wirklich gut gefallen, denn trotz seines Minimalismus untermalt er das Geschehen wirklich hervorragend. Abgesehen davon ist THE GAME audiovisuell nicht weiter erwähnenswert, was für einen Thriller allerdings auch völlig ausreichend ist. THE GAME hat ein mittelmäßiges/schwaches Skript und ohne David Fincher und sein inszenatorisches Talent wäre der Film wirklich nicht gut. Aber der Film ist nun Mal von David Fincher und der ist nun Mal ein toller Regisseur. Die 130 Minuten Laufzeit vergehen wie im Flug, Spannung ist gegeben, die Inszenierung top und sowohl schauspielerisch, als auch audiovisuell kann man sich nicht groß beklagen. Wer über inhaltliche Schwächen hinwegsehen kann, bekommt einen ziemlich tollen Thriller geboten. Am Ende beweist THE GAME, dass David Fincher ein fabelhaften Regisseur ist - und das, obwohl THE GAME bei weitem nicht sein bester Film ist.","",4,NA,4,"R2788BJAYLFQ09","","Tim Gertz","True","Game","Reviewed in Germany on July 19, 2020",2020,"July","Sunday","2020/07","Q3",2020 Q3,"Germany"

"B002H09I0Y",2018-02-12,"Ante todo, para evitar confusiones, este comentario es de la edición española en Blu ray (ASIN B0055KOJZC) de ""The Game"", lanzada por Universal en versión 1 disco (con lo cual no hay un maldito extra de interés, como de costumbre). Varios idiomas (inglés y castellano incluidos) así como subtítulos (castellano igualmente incluido). Muy buena calidad de imagen, especialmente interesante considerando el gran trabajo del director de fotografía Harris Savides que construye un ambiente frío, gélido e inquietante pero en escenarios habitualmente en penumbra o nocturnos, con lo cual la diferencia de calidad entre el DVD y el Bluray es notable. El sonido, por contra, aun siendo bueno, no brilla a la misma altura a mi juicio, pero en conjunto el nivel de calidad es alto. En relación a la película en sí, es el tercer largometraje de Fincher, rodado en 1997 entre dos de sus grandes éxitos, ""Seven"" y ""El Club de la Lucha"". En contraste, el recibimiento de ""The Game"" fue mucho menos entusiasta, pero con el tiempo la película, pese a estar un tanto olvidada, ha demostrado su valía. Cuenta como un rico, duro y solitario hombre de negocios (Michael Douglas) recibe un regalo de su hermano (Sean Penn) consistente en la participación en una especie de ""juego de rol"" sobre el que no le da ninguna pista para mantener la sorpresa. La cosa se complica cuando el juego en cuestión empieza a resultar inquietante y progresivamente angustioso, a medida en que Douglas comienza a sentirse espiado, perseguido y acosado. El problema de ""The Game"" es que se vende como un thriller de acción, una especie de ""Con la Muerte en los Talones"" de Hitchcock, y aunque tiene algo de ello, no es eso exactamente. Por eso muchos espectadores se sintieron engañados al comprobar el lento ritmo de la película (pasa al menos media hora de metraje hasta que el juego comienza verdaderamente) y el tiempo que emplea en analizar la existencia del protagonista, un triunfador que lo tiene todo a nivel material pero carece de cualquier vínculo afectivo real, habiendose endurecido y deshumanizado como consecuencia del suicidio de su padre cuando él era un niño, que le obligó a madurar antes de tiempo. El juego a que se ve sometido pone su ordenada vida de ejecutivo patas arriba y le hace pasar por situaciones angustiosas, pero también le revela lo vacía, frágil e insegura que es la posición de hombre poderoso, respetado y rico que él creía intocable. La interpretación de Michael Douglas es excelente (en la onda de su personaje de gran financiero de ""Wall Street"", solo que aquí obligado por las circunstancias a humanizarse paulatinamente) y sobre todo el trabajo de Fincher y su equipo técnico es excepcional, creando un magnífico ambiente de frialdad y amenaza soterrada en callejuelas solitarias, grandes edificios o lujosos despachos que va haciéndose progresivamente inquietante hasta alcanzar la desesperación de un hombre que se siente, a su pesar, convertido en una marioneta sometida a un perverso juego que no controla, sino que le controla a él. El final de la historia (que no voy a contar, claro) también resultó decepcionante para muchos espectadores, pero a mí me parece, aunque algo rebuscado, acorde con el verdadero espíritu de la película. Una película que requiere paciencia por parte del espectador en su pausada y minuciosa construcción de la telaraña argumental que envuelve a Douglas poco a poco, pero que, una vez vista y reflexionada adecuadamente, se revela como una de las joyas más infravaloradas de ese gran cineasta que es David Fincher.","",7,NA,5,"R190QYKQPIFX68","","Ruperto","True","Game","Reviewed in Spain on February 12, 2018",2018,"February","Monday","2018/02","Q1",2018 Q1,"Spain"

Der Schriftzug THE GAME, der Puppenkopf, die Puzzle Teile und das 20th Logo sind nach außen geprägt, und in Hochglanz gehalten. Die Marionette auf der Rückseite ist auch Hochglanz aber nicht geprägt. Das restliche Steel (schwarz) ist in matt gehalten. Auch haben wir in der Innenseite vom Steelbook einen kompletten INNENDRUCK. (Zu sehen Michael Douglas, Sean Penn und einige Puzzle Teile) Stellt man das Steelbook ins Regal kann man den Titel THE GAME auf rotem Untergrund begutachten. Das ganze für (12,99€ Neupreis bei erscheinen) sollte sich jeder Steelbook Fan gönnen. Ein kleines Mango das ich persönlich nicht so gemacht hätte ist der Schriftzug 20th ANNIVERSARY auf dem roten Puzzle Teil auf der Vorderseite.

"B002H09I0Y",2017-04-23,"Alles in Allem ein gelungener Thriller, dessen einzige Schwäche es ist, dass alles zu sehr ""Schlag auf Schlag"" geht.. Man weiß manchmal nicht, was gehört zum Spiel (für den Hauptdarsteller), und was passiert ihm als reales Leben. Manchmal weiß man es, manchmal glaubt man nur es zu wissen, und manchmal ist man sich nicht sicher. Das macht den Reiz dieses Films aus. Manchmal wünscht man sich (zumindest ich), dass das Geschehen mal etwas zurück genommen wird, um wenigstens als Zuschauer mal durch pusten zu können, aber immer wenn man mal den Eindruck hat, dass dem so ist, ist man bereits im nächsten Kapitel des Films angelangt, und es wird bald ""in einen höheren Gang geschaltet"". Hauptdarsteller Michael Douglas, aber auch die beiden größten Nebenrollen Sean Penn und Deborah Kara Unger spielen es hervorragend. Fazit: Vermutlich wird man den Film nicht oft schauen, da man das Ende beim zweiten Mal ja bereits kennt, aber es wird trotzdem ein sehr gelungener, hochspannender und unterhaltsamer Thriller bleiben.

"B002H09I0Y",2017-02-04,"""Da verabschieden sich tausend Dollar..."" ""Ihre Schuhe kosten TAUSEND Dollar???"" ""Der eine da."" Ein Einsamer an der Spitze reflektiert über sein Leben. Er ist jetzt 48 - in dem Alter hat sich sein Vater vom Dach fallen lassen. Sechshundert Millionen Dollar verwaltet der Mann. Er wohnt allein in seiner Gralsburg in Frisco, betreut nur von einer älteren Dame, die im Dienstbotenhaus wohnt. Die beiden kennen sich seit er denken kann. Er hatte mal eine Frau, aber die ist jetzt mit einem Kinderarzt zusammen in Erwartung des zweiten Kindes. Sein einziger naher Verwandter ist sein kleiner Bruder, ein Mann, der sein Geld arbeiten lässt. Nun tritt er wieder in das Leben des Mannes und schenkt ihm eine Karte der ""CRS"" Consumer Recreation Service"". Die CRS bieten ein Spiel an, maßgeschneidert für den Klienten. Der Einsame wird die Spitze so weit aus den Augen verlieren wie nie in seinem Leben. Das teure Schuhwerk wird er noch am leichtesten verkraften. Der Film hat jetzt zwei Dekaden auf dem Buckel, darf praktisch als Allgemeinwissen betrachtet werden. Daher mit ruhigem Gewissen folgendes: Hand aufs Herz, wer hätte nicht auch auf den Mann im weißen Anzug geschossen - in der Situation. Damals anno 97 im Kino hätte ich dem Michale Douglas aber statt der Puffen eine Flak oder einen Raketenwerfer vergönnt.","",0,NA,4,"R1772Y13VMC7FF","","HAUSMASDA","True","Game","Reviewed in Germany on February 4, 2017",2017,"February","Saturday","2017/02","Q1",2017 Q1,"Germany"

"B002H09I0Y",2013-05-29,"Fand ich irgendwie immer nicht sehr sympathisch, aber er macht gute Filme wie Wallstreet oder eben The Game. Dieser Titel ist wirklich nicht umsonst früher schon sehr viel gelobt worden. Ich hab viel gesehen, aber der Film hat schon einen außergewöhnlich selten und speziellen Charme. Jeder der sich überraschen lässt wird überrascht, den der Film ist wirklich unvorhersehbar, etwas was die meisten Filme nicht haben. Vor 16-17 Jahren ist da jemand sehr inspiritiert gewesen von Film wie ES usw, welches aber Filme danach geistig Anstöße gab. Den Film schau ich aufjedenfall auch noch irgendwann ein 2 mal. Der Titel verspricht wenig, die Bildqualität ist auch nicht astrein, aber die Story ist so verrückt & ausgeklügelt, das alleine das schon 5.0 Sterne bekommt, die Bildqualität und Nebendarsteller sind gut, müssen aber klar 1-2 Abstriche machen außer Sean Penn der 4.5 bekommt und Douglas 4.75 bekommt der Rest 4.00, Bild 3.75 für mich insgesamt ein sehr knappes 4.25 mit Tendenz nach oben zum 5 Stern. WIrklich meiner Meinung nach SEHR EMPFEHLENSWERT"" wo die Spitze ""Super"" eben auf atomarere Ebenen knapp verpasst wurde. Für Fans des Thrillers, David Fincher oder Douglas/ Sean ein klarer Kaufgrund, aber die werden es eh schon haben fürn Rest auf Probe zu genießen.","",2,NA,4,"R1WI3PMFZ4NK9P","","Alex","True","Game","Reviewed in Germany on May 29, 2013",2013,"May","Wednesday","2013/05","Q2",2013 Q2,"Germany"

"B0937GK8MQ",2012-05-04,".......... THANKS to the informative reviews that were already written I decided to buy this one and don't regret it at all....... ABHISHEK GET'S HIS ""GAME"" ON. TOP drawer all the way. Pleasing cinematography, fight sequences that use a lot of old school common sense in the filming ; no jerking the camera around during the scenes beyond what is needed (a pet peeve of mine) . The travel log worthy visuals and dialogue you can follow are just cream on the cake. A naughty ""Cabaret"" dance scene that is definitely NOT FOR KIDDIES. We're talking fishnets and leather imagery with suggestive poses not bump dancing. Bought This one from KHAN'S STORE SUPPLIED BY AMAZON. NO PROBLEMS SO FAR. I will just state that the essentials are as follows : four people who are all in desperate situations are sent letters each with it's own enticement for that individual . They are all told to show up on the same day on a billionaires private island. The big reveal style show down in the dining room and the next day big dramatic moment.... The Director delivers. There's no sitting around on the island for five days waiting to have tea with old ladies pontificating on their navel lint. You are a suspect and instead you are trying to lose a vigilant IVS surveillance team . The director wisely uses the chase scenes to show you some excellent scenery of Istanbul . I can't believe Abhi made it up that hill man ; I would of been in the hospital by then with my heart attack. He's pretty good at evasion. Leading people around to make them see what he wants seen. The only flaw for me was in the very beginnings fight scene where Abi turns the lights off. It's hard to see that one scene. Turn the brightness up higher and don't blink or you'll miss some Bourne Identity fight moves. The rest of the scenes are well lit. You've maybe guessed some or all of the plot depending on your who done it skills and yet you are hoping it's nowhere near done as you are having too much FUN watching Abhishek kicking ass and getting his vengeance on. Excellent bluesy music numbers used throughout. Nice artistry to the opening and in the end a video in similar style with the stars dancing.

"B0937GK8MQ",2012-01-23,"Four strangers invited to a remote Greek island, four strangers due a comeuppance. Abhishek Bachchan heads a strong cast in GAME, a slick Bollywood thriller laced with elements of the whodunit. Like most Bollywood pictures, GAME is constructed in two parts. In the first half, the reclusive tycoon Kabir Malhotra (Anupam Kher) requests the presence of these four strangers just when they require sanctuary the most. Thailand's shady Prime Minister candidate, O.P. Ramsay (Boman Irani), is frantic to escape the media's damning questions. Boozy crime journalist Tisha Khanna (Shahana Goswami) was just bailed out of prison for drunk driving. Casino owner and cool customer Neil Menon (Bachchan) is on the run from Columbian drug lords. And famous actor Vikram Kapoor (Jimmy Shergill) is hiding a corpse in his luggage. Kabir Malhotra's letter to each guest extends a lucrative proposition. But, of course, he has something entirely different in mind. Somewhere, Agatha Christie is smirking. ****POSSIBLY SOME SPOILERS NOW**** On his private island, Malhotra unveils his true motivations. In this or that way, these four strangers are somehow linked to the death of his daughter (Sarah Jane Dias), and this enraged father means to mete out retribution. As such, he informs his guests that, come morning, police authorities will arrive to collect Malhotra's compiled evidence which implicate three of them. The fourth one, the crime journalist, is revealed, to her shock, as the fraternal twin sister of Malhotra's deceased daughter, Maya. Her resentment marks her as a suspect for what happens next. You haven't been around the block if you can't guess what happens next. The next morning finds Kabir Malhotra dead at his desk, his brains blown out by his own hand. Or that's what the first impression would suggest. Chief Investigating Officer Sia Agnihotri (Kangana Ranaut) of the IVS (International Vigilance Squad) doesn't buy it. Something's nagging at her. Forced to release all the suspects, she sanctions a surveillance ops on the four strangers who've scattered across the globe back to their homes. She lavishes particular attention on the clever, unflappable Neil Menon. She remarks to her aide: ""It's not over."" And on the motorboat rapidly pulling away from the isle, Neil Menon echoes her sentiment. The film's second half tracks Sia Agnihotri's near obssessive investigation of the four, despite her supervisor's repeated orders to back off. ****END OF SPOILERS**** Maybe Abhishek's wife can give Sarah Jane Dias a few dancing lessons? Dias is fine as the tragic figure around which the plot revolves. This is her film debut, her what used to be Miss India of 2007. And, given, she isn't given much to do but look waifish, and she is objectified for most of the film. But she makes the most of it; her presence anchors the plot. Given Bollywood's tendency to inject a musical number anytime, anywhere in the movie, Dias does need to brush up on her bust-a-move skills. As far as the tracks themselves go, I'm really digging the title song ""It's a Game"" and the wicked club banger ""Kaun Hai Ajnabi"" and will probably download them soon. GAME marks Abhinay Deo's directorial debut, him what used to be an advertisement director. Credit him and the cinematographer for staging the sets in vivid ways. GAME looks beautiful and makes good use of its exotic locales (Mumbai, Bangkok, Istanbul, London, the Greek island). You can't dismiss the film's technical strength. Nor can you overlook the cast's solid performances. I thought that Anupam Kher as the vengeance-minded billionaire and Abhishek were particularly good. GAME has several exciting action sequences in which Abhishek's character employs martial arts, and it's fun to watch Abhishek lay down moments of sheer assskickery. Abhishek exudes an elegance and a palpable craftiness. You get the sense that from the minute he landed on the island his character right away had begun putting the pieces together. The only fault lies in Abhishek's jogging which even Steven Seagal - whose hands limply flop around when he runs - says looks funny. Besides, the sequence in which Abhishek jogs in Istanbul - while pursued rather obviously by IVS agents - takes too long to arrive at its payoff. It's a taut thriller and there are some nice twists. But there's a bone to pick if you're a mystery buff. Regarding the murder-solving, the film doesn't really play fair with the audience. The clues are supposed to have been there from the start, so that we, too, can have a stab at the killer's identity. Instead what we get are late reveals and introductions of new characters late in the game. There is also the logic hole in the murder itself. How the investigative officers were able to determine that the death was murder instead of suicide is pretty neat, if not exactly new or inventive. The problem is that the killer is someone who's known the victim long enough to not make such a bonehead mistake in framing the suicide in the manner (s)he did. Somewhere, Agatha Christie is muttering in disgust. So, as an entertaining thriller... definitely. But as a credible whodunit? Not as much. But I still recommend it because I had an incredibly good time watching it. This DVD also comes with a comprehensive 42-minute ""Making of the Film"" featurette which is mostly in English.","",0,NA,4,"R238N3LU7SRQWD","entertaining, if flawed, desi whodunit thriller","H.

I didn't watch this show regularly when it aired and since I miss more re-runs than I watch, I decided to buy the set. This season is a hilarious representation of the lives of professional football players & has become my entertainment crack! I got sucked into the lives of wide-eyed rookie receiver, Derwin Davis & his ""Girl"" Melanie Barnett as they struggle to fit in with fellow players, players' wives/girlfriends, image consultants & agents while fighting to maintain their relationship & down-to-earth values. The ups & downs of their relationship are balanced out by the lives & problems of 2 of his teammates: Jason & Kelly Pitts - married for 7 years, Jason is fearful about the impending end of his football career & having never won the championship while Kelly battles her feelings of resentment towards Jason for his controlling behavior; and Malik Wright & Tasha Mack - star QB & his ""Momager"". Malik at 25 yrs is living it up as ""The $40-million Kid"" but wonders if it's time to cut the apron strings while Tasha fights to prove herself in the business world as more than just the lucky woman who gave birth to a star athlete.

"B09B1FNZJJ",2022-03-04,"Good for a new product, but definitely has room for improvement. I am an avid board game player, with over 400 board games in my game room. I wanted to add something more accessible for the grandkids, trying to entice them from a purely electronic entertainment medium to one that requires more human interaction. While it works quite well for that. It definitely could use improvements: The legs that are supplied for it are sturdy and attach well, but they place the surface of the table far too low for comfort. I switched you placing the game surface on a card table, but this makes it a little too high. I am going to custom make a table to hold this product at the correct height, but I don’t think I should have to do so. The power and volume control buttons are recessed far underneath the table, where they are hard to reach, let alone see. I’m sure this is to prevent accidental pushes of the button, but this is poorly executed and extremely awkward to use. For accidental powering off, the table already asks for a second input if you really want to turn it off, so this is really unnecessary. Ironically, on some games, the off button for that game is on the surface of the game table itself and can be executed with one accidental touch. This forces you to restart the game. The power cord is also poorly designed. I suspect it was made this way to protect the table from being destroyed by someone tripping over the cord, but the result of the current product design is that any small impact on the cord disconnects the power source. At the very least a small battery back up should be supplied to give you a few seconds to reconnect if this accident occurs. Otherwise the design needs to change. Despite a very high-quality table, the company supplies hopelessly inadequate screens to conceal your cards or scrabble cubes or whatever. They only supply four when five is sometimes what you need. They are made out of flimsy cardboard with plastic clips at the bottom that don’t stay attached properly. They are also too small to cover the area required. I have purchased excellent aftermarket covers which fix these problems, but on this level of gaming table they should be supplied. Otherwise our family has enjoyed using this table. Ticket to Ride is a family favorite. I think Carcassonne, and Settlers of Catan would both work well on this table. Maybe Alhambra as well. I very much look forward to future increases in game options available.","",9,NA,4,"RD1S1CUV5K9UF","Good for a new product, definitely has room for improvement.","Donald P Samms","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2022",2022,"March","Friday","2022/03","Q1",2022 Q1,"the United States"

Nothing would fix it and you couldn’t do anything. Tried factory resetting it and then I couldn’t even log in. I couldn’t type my username because it still thought someone was pressing it in the same spot. I thought it was a fluke and returned it for a new one. New unit came and after only one day started doing the same thing, only this time it thought someone was repeatedly pressing the upper left hand corner of the screen. A factory reset did the same as the last unit, where I couldn’t log in after. Frustrated, this time I returned it for a full refund. There is obviously something wrong with the touch screen on these. It’s really too bad. Like I said, it was really fun when it worked. My kids and I were really looking forward to playing more games on it this weekend, and we’re all really disappointed.

"B08ZYDR8KF",2021-11-07,"After dinner, we like to play games as a family. The games have to be quick and easy to learn and play….a prerequisite in this house because some people get bored very easily. So when I saw this ‘Shut The Box’ dice game by Amerous, I figured it was worth a try. Up to six players can play this game, and the rules are super simple. The way they are written in the included instructions makes it all very easy to understand. You can complete a game in under 15 minutes with no problem. The game board is nicely constructed of solid wood. The number tiles are easy to see and flip up and down easily. And the bed of the game board is lined with felt, so there’s no sound of the dice hitting wood every time someone rolls the. That, for me, is greatly appreciated. This is definitely a well-made game board. I’m sure that there are a lot of different variations to this game you can come up with to keep everyone interested. It’s just a great addition to anyone’s game collection. We all enjoyed playing it and will keep on playing it in the future.

"B08ZYDR8KF",2021-11-02,"In an age where any game has to come with enough bells, whistles, bang, clang, and twang, to light a christmas house, it's nice to come across an old-timey game that requires none of that. It can be played by as few as ONE player; requires NO batteries and comes in sizes and styles that make it, not only portable on the one end, but an attractive bit of decor (not unlike, albeit not as elaborate, as a fine chess set) on the other I speak, of course, of ""shut the box"" But you knew that or you wouldn't be on this page This is a very nice, and relatively elaborate set I would say that it even comes in a very nice looking gift box if it weren't for the fact fact that the address label was pasted right on the presentation box and won't come off without tearing Ah, well......","",0,NA,4,"R1GHE7UK93A06B","Shut the box, go away!

"B08ZYDR8KF",2021-11-01,"I like that this version of Shut The Box allows for a family of 5 to play together. The dice are brightly colored which is fun for the kids to choose their favorite color. Game play is easy and all you really need to do is count the number on the dice and then flip over the playing pieces that correspond to that number. So if you roll a FIVE, you can flip down a 5, or a 1 and 4, or a 2 and 3, if available to you. At its easiest, you can take turn until no one can flip times anymore. If someone flips their last pieces over to complete the board, they have SHUT THE BOX! The only criticism I have is that this is a relatively small version of the game. I'd prefer a game design with wider pieces so it's easier to select and flip them without flipping the neighboring piece by mistake.","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/811wIFe-hiL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81l8+iUt75L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rCGqxsepL._SY88.jpg']",3,NA,4,"R1UI3EAHHXI64N","Shut The Box game for a family of 5, or 6….

Really nothing to teach or learn; it's that simple. The one real goofy thing is their choice of player pawns. They are conical (like incense). They just go flying everywhere if your fingers are dry or greasy (which is a no-no anyhow). They just shoot out of your fingers almost always knocking over the other pawns. I don't know how this wasn't caught. Most of us gamers have bags of meeples, so it's an easy fix. We tell players to set the piece on the board, then slide it to your square.

By misprints, I mean someone will think they have a dark purple and on the board it’ll be lime green. So, needless to say clues don’t end well when those pop up.

"B084D2XQ9F",2021-09-02,"I got a free copy of Hues and Cues through Tryazon in exchange for my honest review. The game got really mixed reviews. PROS: The board game is really colorful and pretty. Ben liked it. Clark thought it was easy to learn. Traci thought it was fun, but didn’t want to play more that one game. CONS: The game pieces were a little bit slippery and sometimes hard to place on the board, especially when the pieces were clustered together. The game was very hard with only giving 1 or 2 word clues. The game also seemed to go on for a long time. Suzy thought it was boring. Mike didn’t like it and felt it was redundant. SUGGESTIONS: This game is too hard for kids — keep it with adults only. Instead of just one or two words, try using full descriptive sentences, or even make it a bit of a story. “As I was walking one early spring morning, I noticed the dew glistening on the grass in the field as the sun rose.” Add time limits to speed up the game. For example, you get 10 seconds to think of a description and 3 seconds to place your piece on the board.","",0,NA,3,"R3A1ZHBMX4XIMR","Mixed reviews from game night","SavvyChris","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2021",2021,"September","Thursday","2021/09","Q3",2021 Q3,"the United States"

"B084D2XQ9F",2021-01-24,"I was very pleased with this one. The concept is unique and the game play is very fun. After the initial play with the family I was rating it as one of my all time best picks and one of the best board games we've played. Then after the second play I was realizing that whilst there are technically 480 different colors there are actually really only about 8 different colors as the gradient shades wind up blending together and are not distinct enough so much so that even after playing two times the same basic clues were being repeated. If you're describing a yellowish-green shade you'll say something like ""lime"" and then ""more grassy"". And then the next time you describe a greenish-yellow shade you'll find yourself saying ""lime"" and then ""inside lime"" (hoping to denote the inside of a lime). And so I could see and basically have seen this becoming very repetitive very quickly. So that being said I would still recommend it if you buy and collect and play a ton of board games as this might still be a hoot once a year or maybe even once every couple or few years. However if you're not a big board gamer and are looking for a lot of bang and replay value in a short time out of a few selections I'd probably advise you avoid this one.

You are suppose to give one word clues and there are only so many words you can use to describe a color. You are not suppose to use objects in your surrounding area. For example if I choose a green color, I might use the word ""grass"" but see grass can have different colors to different people so it's kinda dumb. The only thing that has made this game worth the money is the game board is really cool looking and we have been able to create our own rules and at least made the game a better game.

It was a lot of fun, easy to use and learn and basically a less shocking version of Cards Against Humanity (which we own) the younger crowd seems to love this game and there are a lot of really funny played cards. The problem was that my 12 year old really wanted to play with us and so we removed the “kid inappropriate” cards. Then she loved playing with us and asked for the game for her birthday. After a lot of thought and reading reviews I bought it for her birthday. It did take 5 adults reading every single card to remove any “kid inappropriate” cards but it is possible if your not a super weird strict parent to remove all the “super inappropriate” cards from the deck. My daughter and her friends had a great time playing with the the rest of the deck. I didn’t count all the cards we removed but it was a quarter of the total cards.

"B097B1ZJ5T",2022-03-25,"Let's start by saying Nintendo knows that quality assurance with nostalgic products at least are of the utmost importance. I don't have a Switch and I know the joy-con drift situation is a pain point, but with this device and the NES Classic that I do own you can tell they care about their legacy. As a collector's piece, an interactive one at that, both for Legend of Zelda and for Game&Watch this is a beautiful thing to put on the shelf. Emulation of the games appear perfect. I have two minor issues and honestly I understand both of them. The size of the device and by extension the screen is a bit of a pain point. Still fully usable and I have larger hands, but I can see where this might bother others who are used to a Switch or a premium phone screen for gaming. I tend to think the dimensions of the device are mainly to simulate the original G&W dimensions and if looked at in that spirit it makes perfect sense. Nevertheless, I get why some might wonder why it wasn't slightly larger across the board. The second minor critique would be the version of Link's Awakening. I grew up on the original and again if this is about paying homage to the classics I get it. I personally would have liked to see the Gameboy Color version, but Link's Awakening 93 is still both perfectly playable and one of my favorite 2-D Zelda's of all-time if only because of how much it experiments with the game mechanics and narrative when compared to the masterpiece that was A Link to the Past. Miyamoto not being involved in the gameboy game was a blessing because the team wasn't hindered by his input being very strict to certain ideas of what Zelda can and should be. I think the device is a testament to a time when Zelda wasn't a formula, but an experiment that had good and bad conclusions, hence the inclusion of Adventures of Link which was a look at Zelda in a different way that has a very marred reputation. So should you buy it? If you love Zelda and like collectibles with superb build quality, yes. If you just want to play old games on a handheld, I might look elsewhere as the market is full of options for this that don't include the Nintendo premium costs but also doesn't include their build quality or reputation either.","",0,NA,4,"RXGUUG0513A05","Minor quips, quality product","Ben Fisher","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2022",2022,"March","Friday","2022/03","Q1",2022 Q1,"the United States"

"B097B1ZJ5T",2022-03-23,"This is a really neat looking & fun piece of nostalgia. I never played any of the original Game & Watch devices when they were originally introduced, but I always wanted one. With the retroactive hype currently happening for old game systems nowadays, these devices have surged in popularity and collectibility. I had to have one! Unfortunately, as fantastic as this device is... it's just too small. I was expecting this device to be much larger than it physically is; I guess the person pictured (here) holding the device is a child or has very small hands. I wear an X-Large glove size, so this device is very tiny in my hands, and somewhat difficult to use. The screen makes is difficult to see as well. Just be aware of these factors when purchasing. I remember playing a lot of games with a D-Pad (Directional Pad) and action buttons, but it's amazing how much I'm used to a controller with thumb-sticks now. Playing this game the way things used to be is quite a bit more challenging than I expected. It took me some getting used to using this control setup again. Overall, I really like The Legends of Zelda Game & Watch handheld. It's a fun way to play these classic games, and take them anywhere you go.

"B097B1ZJ5T",2021-12-13,"TLDR: Not reliable or usable as portable alarm clock, limited battery and small controls wears nostalgia thin. I enthusiastically bought this as an early Xmas present myself. Loved NES and GB Zelda's at the perfect age, as well as Mario's Cement Factory G&W and similar handhelds of the 80's. I even had a Zelda LCD watch. I'd use the G&W as a portable clock and alarm as a kid on trips, camping, etc.. Was hoping to do the same here, so I could use it as a cool portable clock for upcoming travel. The original G&W had a little kickstand to hold it up as a clock - this does not. It doesn't have an actual alarm (some but not all reviews note this). It's only ""functional"" as a clock when plugged in, so the screen can stay on, but not on battery. And if the battery is low don't be surprised if the clock is dead in the morning. I hoped to have this sitting around as a cool clock at home and travel, with dependable battery that I would occasionally pick up and play, but this is not the designed use case. They could very easily have put in an alarm, kickstand, and a simple OG B&W retro clock mode. Instead, gold color plus glowing triforce plus nostalgia equals fifty bucks.","",0,NA,3,"R8WIGNO8O1K6Q","Misses the mark for actual use as game or watch","Mike H","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2021",2021,"December","Monday","2021/12","Q4",2021 Q4,"the United States"

This game had a nice green color on the back and a gold color on the front. The screen is really small, but you can change the brightness to see better. This game is so small that you can put it in your pocket. This game had only the charger cord, but no plug and the cord is too short. There’s a way to recharge this game, you can use an iPhone charger. When I put this game’s charger cord on my iPhone plug and put it on this game and guess what? It started charging. This game had all of the games; Legend of Zelda, Zelda 2, Link’s Awakening, Vermin, the clock game and Timer. On the Vermin game, the rules are simple; you move Link to hit those monsters called Octoroks who are hiding underground until they pop out and you move Link and he hits them with his hammers. The more Octoroks you kill, the more points you earn. You have three strikes, once you got your third strike, it’s game over. I really wish they add the Oracle games in this Game and Watch. I gave this game a five star rating and I really recommend this to Zelda collectors.","",3,NA,5,"R14R17OR7ANAWQ","It’s dangerous to go alone.","David Cook","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2021",2021,"November","Tuesday","2021/11","Q4",2021 Q4,"the United States"
"B097B1ZJ5T",2021-11-22,"I want to preface this with the important part. There are four games included, one of which is a very simple game that may as well not even count, and you cannot add more games to this. If you are buying this as a gift, please consider the age of the person you are buying this for. The games on this device are very old and younger people tend to look down on these games as ""poorly aged"", while I cannot say I agree with the sentiment, I have seen it often enough to know it's pretty commonplace. This is more of a collectors item. This is Nintendo's Follow up to last year's Super Mario Bros. themed Game & Watch. It's essentially the same thing, a fancy interactive clock with some games built into it. However this one is a much better value in my opinion. You see, the Super Mario Bros one had only three games on it. Super Mario Bros. the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 ( which we call ""The Lost Levels"" in the west ), and the Game & Watch Game: Ball with Mario's face slapped onto it. Lost Levels can be seen as a glorified expansion pack to the first Super Mario games, it is barely different mechanically and visually, and very few people enjoy it as it is far more difficult than the first. The Zelda Game and Watch packs in four games. The original Legend of Zelda, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, The Legend of Zelda; Link's Awakening, and the Game & Watch game, Vermin. Zelda 1 and 2 are very different games, and while Zelda fans are still divisive about weather Zelda 2 is a good game or not, most retro game enthusiasts agree that it is. And Link's Awakening is very much a full length adventure game, Nintendo is even now currently selling a slightly enhanced ( but otherwise the same ) version of this game for Switch for $60. It holds up very well. Vermin is a fun diversion which I prefer over Ball, but it is pretty weak as far as Game and Watch titles go. For those curious, the Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening is the original Gameboy release. There is no option to play the DX release for Gameboy Color, and it is displayed in Black and White with pale green shading. If there is a way to change the display settings to look more like an original Gameboy or Gameboy pocket, I do not know. This device also allows you to change which version of the game you are playing. This may not seem like a big deal, but the two NES games had pretty different sound and graphics and a few mechanical differnces as well in Japan, and Link's Awakening had a lot of censorship in the localized version. Granted, you should play the games in your native language unless you are intimately familiar with the game or you have learned a second language. It's a fun novelty to experience how different these games were overseas, I think I may even prefer the Japanese Zelda 1 for it's superior sound effects. The games automatically save your position wherever you started playing last, so when you return to your game, you'll be exactly where you left off, you can go back to the title screen by hitting the ""set/time"" button and selecting reset game. This game also has the regular sram saves, and the different language versions of the games have their own save data. It has the same clock that the Super Mario Bros. Game & Watch had. It displays the time, and a Zelda 1 style animation of Link going on a quest to collect trifroce pieces and defeat ganon, a quest he completes every 12 hours. It also has some features the Super Mario Bros. one didn't have. For starters, you can choose to turn off automatic sleep mode, in case you are displaying this on a stand as a clock. Granted this will drain the batter, but it it's an option. Previously, the only way to keep the Mario device from entering sleep mode was to keep it plugged into a charger. ( on a side note, I would advise against this, as it would be murder on the battery. ) You can set a timer, which changes the screen to Zelda 2 style, and has Link fight an onslaught of enemies from Zelda 2 as the timer ticks down. In both the clock, and the timer, you can choose to control Link, though it does not earn you any rewards, though the timer does keep score of the number of baddies you defeat. This clock does not appear to have any of the secret animations or original illustrations that the Mario device had unfortunately, though the Triforce mark on the back does glow when the device is in use, it's a really nice touch. Personally speaking, I really like this device. It's not perfect and missed some opportunities, but the games included on it are some of my favorites, and I feel like I could see myself playing with this device a lot more frequently than the Mario one.","",8,NA,5,"R3L3XC7ECCN3JN","Nifty little collectors item for classic Zelda fans","Ryan","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2021",2021,"November","Monday","2021/11","Q4",2021 Q4,"the United States"

"B097B1ZJ5T",2021-11-17,"If there's one thing I should address before this review, it's that I was a 1990s kid, and was an infant at the tail end of the 80s decade, I never grew up with the Game & Watch series and only knew about Nintendo's green screened brick handheld, although I did own a few Tiger electronic handheld games which were close enough to G&W as it was. But, I'm just stating my history here. The Legend of Zelda modern Game & Watch is a fine nostalgia trip into Nintendo's past era of gaming, where 8-bit games were still going strong, three classic titles, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and the Game Boy game, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening are all included on the small system, along with a small twist on the classic Game & Watch game, Vermin as you play as Link hammering down a bunch of.... octoroks? that's what they look like anyway! All of the games are preserved working in perfect quality, with a game pause feature allowing you to continue where you left off, changing screen brightness, and even having an exclusive little screensaver for each game if you leave the games idle for a while. On top of that, the handheld also has its own clock that you can adjust the time to, and exclusive for this handheld is setting a timer and playing a fun minigame of defeating as many enemies as possible as the timer goes down. The handheld itself feels very sleek fitting right into the palms of your hands, and a nice rubbery feel to the buttons, apparently feeling accurate to how the original 1980s Game & Watch systems did. I've heard nitpicks from certain social media comments saying they wished that Nintendo went with the DX version of Link's Awakening, but I think in theory Nintendo wanted to use the 1993 release as the original Game Boy and Game & Watch released in the same decade, and really, I have no complaints about that. Some may not take a liking to the pricing, especially when scalpers have to bring up the price higher, but if you can manage to grab a copy on the retail shelf for its actual price, I highly recommend picking one up, as these may not last for long.","",10,NA,5,"R34CUQJCMB3TXH","A tiny handheld jam-packed with nostalgia!","Benjamin Mills","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2021",2021,"November","Wednesday","2021/11","Q4",2021 Q4,"the United States"

Charging is a cinch, note that it uses a USB-C cable for those duties. Sound is...well, let's say Retro and that it's entirely appropriate for the games. The speaker is on the left side of the unit and can be inadvertently covered up by your hand during play though. As for the games, yeah they are the exact games. Saving games is possible here as well. Only real nit I have is that the form factor is a touch small so that makes gameplay (for me) a little more challenging.

I feel deeply for the Dragons and The Mother of Dragons, Daenerys They and she along with Cersei Carry the entire Series. Jon Snow is very weak actor yet is the center of the Series. If it had not been for the others around him he would have fallen very badly. He does not carry his role well. All other actors, Sanza, Ayra, are excellent. As for the story, it seems very disappointing the way it turns to a weak person who does nothing really except get the first Dragon killed because of his Ego. Why the writers chose this way is beyond me. This series is not a fairy tell story but a series filled with hate and lust for power. This series could have been and should have been one of the all time greats but falls far short.

"B074RKHNV6",2020-04-11,"Season 7 brings to near completion the main story arc of the clash of Houses Targaryen and Lannister. A battle between the two houses in episode four Spoils of War would seem to set up a final victory march into King’s Landing for victorious House Targaryen. Instead the next episode Eastwall finds Dany seeking to convince Cersei of the danger posed by the White Walkers. Dany seems to have been duped by her advisors and so faces two foes rather than one with House Lannister still intact. But her dragon enforced version of democracy wasn’t really so democratic anyhow. Lady Tyrell advised her to “be a dragon” and Dany’s army stands amassed around King’s Landing waiting for her signal. And the viewers await the battle that usually happens during a season finale. But instead she endures insults from the Lannister entourage as they undergo an awkward round of diplomacy. Jon Snow is brave, tough and many other heroic things but he isn’t the brightest bulb in the lampshade. After narrowly escaping with his life in the battle of Hardhome, did he really think a small group of men would stand a chance facing off with the zombies on their winter turf? And that Cersei would be anything other than herself?","",0,NA,4,"RMKPON4UA276K","Prelude to a Zombie Apocalypse","musicfan28if","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2020",2020,"April","Saturday","2020/04","Q2",2020 Q2,"the United States"

"B074RKHNV6",2019-12-15,"This is what happens when a movie or series is made from a book that is not finished. George Martin is partly to blame here. His books are very clear as to what is happening at any given time. There is no ambiguity about the plot. There are certainly lots of surprises that the readers have to adjust to but overall we know what is going on. When this series overran the books, there was no longer a coherent path to follow and B&B were nowhere near talented enough to second guess where Martin intended to go with his storyline. He should never have let that happen. It was his baby and B&B had no idea how to care for it. They were going on the momentum of the first four books and then the wind left their sails and they slowly but surely fell to earth when they didn't have Martin to guide them anymore. It was painful to watch and maddingly disappointing to realize, episode by episode of this last season, that the train wreck we all hoped would not happen was, in fact, going to be even more spectacular than we could have imagined. I will not buy this last season because I don't need to be reminded again of how much I resented being treated as if I could not tell the difference between good craft and worthless dreck.","",2,NA,1,"RMUFJU483KZN8","Really?

I think here and there it's really boring, many times you feel things are hurried up without any serious climax (like the Dark Lord who is killed suddenly and in few seconds) + the characters you loved throughout the series end up being treacherous, showing such ugly unexpected angles of their character. And on top of that most of the favorite characters die and the less important ones (like the little brother) or the ones who are selfish and mean (like Sansa) end up remaining in power...

We kept wondering thorughout GOT in season 7 and 8 how they could make such idiotic and stupid strategical blunders when it came to dealing with opposing armies. The battle against the night walkers was particularly stupid on the part of the humans, especially when they sent the Dorthraki to massacre, why didn't Dani and Jon burn the nightwalkers down first then send the dorthraki to mop up?

While it was mostly short of the jaw-drop deaths of key characters (though one was extremely well received!) it offered several very big battles and some other significant developments. This series does well across its shorter episode run, though I couldn’t say the same for the following, concluding one.

This season (season 8) started out ok (the first episode) but got progressively worse with each episode. So many questions left unanswered, so many endings that were just dull and dispassionate. Game of thrones changed drastically after season 5, 6 was ok, but seven and 8 especially are weird. They dont feel like the rest of the series. Im going to get the books and start over. The last episode was one of the worst endings to an 8 year show ive seen since Dexter. I usually rewatch the series every year, but i wont ever bother doing that again. Biggest let down ever.

"B074RKHNV6",2019-05-20,"I'm not the type to write reviews often although I do use them a lot in every day's life choices whether to pick a restaurant or buy a certain product. I use exclusively imdb when watching movies and especially before committing to any long series. So you can imagine that I was effected quite seriously since I am drafting this review. Now I started watching The game of thrones in the summer of 2012. My girlfriend and I, were looking for on demand HBO series and stumbled upon the Game of Thrones. Needless to say that after the first 10 minutes, both of us were hooked. A week later I discovered that there was a huge fan base and to my delight, numerous published books. That weekend I bought the first three books from Barnes & Noble and became a loyal fan myself. I have followed the series religiously since then. I have bought memorabilia, t-shirts, and drunk the seasonal beers that were produced in the show's name. I've given many Game of Throne gifts to family members, coworkers and friends. In season 7 however, I sensed that the show makers were going a little bit fast. Too fast for my liking. But I could not predict the disaster of season 8. I can't believe that we had to wait two years for this type of unsophisticated closure of events. A narration that is extremely foreign to the show. It betrays all the seasons which came before it. To top it off, yesterday's episode, the finale, was one of the lamest and corniest episodes ever. An episode with the worst writing I've ever seen on TV, befitting the less sophisticated fan base that the show has sadly amassed during the last two or three seasons. And I apologise to the reader if you are not one of them. I sincerely feel betrayed. I have spent too much money, too much energy, and too much time to be treated like this in the end. I understand the need to end the show because it was getting too expensive for the studio but clearly I didn't expect HBO to sacrifice quality to this drastic level. It is quite surprising and dangerous altogether that they've allowed themselves to sacrifice all the hard work that was accomplished in the past seasons and massacre characters they've so meticulously developed throughout the years simply for the sake of expediency and bottom line.","",0,NA,1,"R2ZSNW5I2LMFB8","I feel Betrayed...And it all started with this season","Howard H","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2019",2019,"May","Monday","2019/05","Q2",2019 Q2,"the United States"

Okay, this is an incredibly well-made series, taken from an excellent series of books (which haven't even been written this far yet, although the storyline will NEVER match-up with the HBO series for a myriad of reasons), but I really HAVE to make a criticism regarding Episode Two (""Stormborn"") in season-seven involving the whole concept of an AMBUSH! We all know what the word ""ambush"" means, correct? You attack your enemy using SURPRISE, usually after your enemy has walked into a carefully set trap. So HOW is it even possible for a large fleet of sailing vessels to ambush an enemy fleet? HOW is it possible that NOBODY on an entire fleet of ships is aware of a large enemy fleet sneaking-up on them? But we're expected to believe that such a things happens in the Narrrow Sea between two fleets of Ironborn ships, specifically planned that way by Euron Greyjoy, who knew for certain that his niece's fleet could be taken completely unawares? Don't get me wrong - this is an OUTSTANDING series, but George R. Martin would NEVER write that kind of crap in one of his books!","",0,NA,5,"R2TZFZLKRHFU6R","Okay, I LOVE this entire series...

I wish they would make a censored version of this movie as well though, so that my whole family could watch it. It is definitely not for kids! There is quite a bit of nudity in most all of the seasons. In my opinion it's right up there with Lord of the rings, only much more graphic and serious. Kind of mixed with the reality of how things would really be, such as a good guy doesn't always win, and also with plenty of cool fantasy, and twists and turns that you don't always predict that's coming, like how it is with a lot of other movies.

"B074RKHNV6",2018-08-18,"If you already have the previous six seasons, going for the next one is almost a given. You can expect the same quality in production, looking and sounding very good in any kind of set up. Missing is the last season recap, although I’m not sure if that is because HBO never made one. There are plenty of additional features to go around, with the most interesting being the Conquest and Rebellion set of animated shorts (it comes in separate disk, in its own box). In terms of the season, well, it holds better watching the episodes back to back, and feels a lot less rushed (especially episode 3) than watching it week by week. The show has always been very character and dialog driven, and the lack of action sequences never felt as a loss. But this season, maybe because most of the characters still alive are not that prone to having long, insightful exchanges, felt rushed in some parts, and very slow in others (the first episode is almost all a set up). And that is even when you have one of the best sequences in the whole show (end of episode 4), and an amazing fight in the north, although for very questionable reasons. Overall, Season 7 of Game of Thrones is still better than most stuff out there, and production wise is top notch. But perhaps the lack of direction from the books, or the excess of freedom from not having a reference source, is very noticeable now. Here is hope Season 8 is an improvement.","",0,NA,4,"R1U2F2SGMCLV4N","Awesome presentation of lackluster season","Juan Carlos Romaina","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2018",2018,"August","Saturday","2018/08","Q3",2018 Q3,"the United States"

"B074RKHNV6",2018-06-21,"The penultimate season for the Game of Thrones is a wild ride. (A quick add! The DVD comes with an animated short, voiced by fan favorites from the series that tells the story of what came prior to the First Season. The animation is very well done and does answer some common fan questions.) If you enjoyed the first six seasons then you simply owe it to yourself to watch this one. The acting is superb. The timing is first rate. The gratuitous sex has been reduced siginifcantly (though not entirely eliminated), and almost all of the plot lines are resolved save the largest. Winter is here, snuggle up, and prepare to be entertained. ** Spoilers Follow ** Littlefinger was behind every bad thing that happened in Westeros over the past 15 years- everything. Aura slits his throat at Sensa's direction. Jon Snow becomes the King in the North and pledged himself to the Mother of Dragons, much like his ancestor. By the by, incest continues to abound in the Dragons as Jon is actually a Dragon himself. Cersei agrees to fight alongside the the other two armies against the undead, tries to remit, and is rebuffed by Jaime. The dead use their new ice dragon to destroy the Wall, and the final scene sees the unstoppable horde marching south into the lands of the living.","",9,NA,5,"RUZTLK9I013UW","Just wow!

"B074RKHNV6",2018-06-21,"By far the best season in terms of action and special effects BUT when I watch it again and have time to think, there are too many “shortcuts “. Therefore have to take one star off. The speed which things happen, ravens fly, and ships sail requires a lot of suspension of disbelief. Not to mention the relationship plots, especially where the Starks are concerned. Great characters all around , whom a lot of folks have come to love despite their differences. That’s why we watched. Best plot line involves the Lannisters. Circe and Jaime finally get to disagree, and despite his maiming Bran, Jaime comes a long way from Season 1. There seems to be a sense of redemption for him in the plot line. We’ll see. For all her absolute wickedness, Circe gets her revenge for her daughter’s murder and one feels little if any remorse for the murderous Dornish women. Still, Circe is unredeemable overall. Tyrion’s plot line was one of the best. Daenerys is restrained through most of it but it’s great to see her go to war on Drogon. The last episode however was not surprising for anyone into GOT lore. Incest is par for the course for Targaryens. As for the Starks. It’s kind of hard to believe that plot line with the ladies when you have a brother who has visions of the past and present. That’s the weakest plot line of all. Sisters fighting not asking him anything and he doesn’t say anything to them either, although it’s obvious he knows Baelish must die. Yet when the crows are cawing after the siblings are finally together, there’s definitely an indication that Baelish was going down. There should have have been much smarter writing, showing the audience how the reunited siblings take him down. Nonetheless Kudos to Aiden Gillen for being a great bad guy. My biggest peeve is who chained up the dragon in the water under the ice if the dead can’t swim? And if at the flap of a dragons wings the dead are sent flying, then why doesn’t Daenerys, and Jon at one point, get knocked off their feet when Drogon takes off with that wing span? Give me a break? That was a stretch. Just because I enjoy fantasy doesn’t mean I’m going to accept clear inconsistencies. The writers will need to step it up for the last season. And hopefully we’ll get more than 7-8 episodes. I have held off reading the books past the first one and hope the next books in the series are better, especially the “yet to be written “ ones.","",0,NA,4,"R3M7LVD6B88CU1","Suspension of disbelief","Melchizedek","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2018",2018,"June","Thursday","2018/06","Q2",2018 Q2,"the United States"

First six episodes played fine but episode 7 starts with a few stuttering scenes and then goes black for a while, then starts playing the FBI warning in every language. Never will play. I took it out of the DVD player and noticed a 1/2 inch scratch on the outer edge. I'm assuming this is the problem.

"B074RKHNV6",2018-06-12,"I enjoyed this season well enough. Had some very exciting episodes. The writing has definitely suffered a little ever since they surpassed the novels, but this review is more about the physical product than the series. If you're like me and have been collecting the seasons on DVD, you may be sad to discover this season is packaged differently. In previous seasons (not sure about 6, hasn't arrived yet), the cases have all been the same size and thickness. This package is about half as thick, which is really going to mess with my OCD as it sits on the shelf next to the others. Included is an animated history lesson which is packaged separately, which was ENTIRELY unnecessary. They could have packed it in with the rest of season 7, and increased the size of the box to match the previous seasons. If you haven't already started purchasing these, then don't start now. Wait until the series is released as a complete set and buy that. It's more likely to match.","",20,NA,3,"R3R9AHU05JZ9J6","Packaging size difference from previous seasons.","Jarrard","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2018",2018,"June","Tuesday","2018/06","Q2",2018 Q2,"the United States"

"B074RKHNV6",2018-06-10,"Season 7 of Game of Thrones is what happens when George R.R. Martin doesn't finish his books. The Starks end up having these happy episodes. HBO is now past the books and is carving out fresh new storylines that may or may not coincide with what Mr. Martin has got planned. Season 7 is gratifyingly the reunion season. Show's almost at the finish line. The show runners and writers are now allowing their sprawling cast to run into each other. There's a sense of driving momentum. Some folks are butt-hurt - detractors who claim that GoT has jumped the shark, that it's strayed from the gritty reality of bad things happening to good people. I disagree. Good people still get sh-- on in Season 7. And I loved the plot progression, the sense of things finally coming to a head. Absolutely, I relished the breadth of intricate, leisurely world-building and rich character development from seasons past. But you have to pay them off at some point, yes? And maybe there's a smidge of legitimacy to those who grouse that travelers in-show seem to have obtained either supersonic ravens or ten-league boots, what with the seemingly time-compressed storytelling and the characters now not spending so much time enroute to places. But is that really what you crave? Scene upon scene upon scene of people journeying from here to there? Think of it this way, then. It's still taking people just as long as before to get to places. It's just that the show isn't bothering to linger on those scenes anymore. To reiterate, there's a sense of momentum now. Pace has accelerated. Winter Is Here. Sh-- is about to go down. One nitpick I'm down with is the one that bags on Bran whose incessant assertion of ""I'm the Three-Eyed Raven"" grates on the nerves more so than Daniel Rand's ""I'm the immortal Iron Fist."" And, yes, the Three-Eyed Raven is still Westeros' version of the Internet. Even the slow burn episodes pack it with game-changing ramifications and happenings. And, yes, be warned: the writers are weeding out longstanding side characters one by one. Not everyone wears plot armor nowadays. For those who haven't watched Season 7 yet, I won't spoil it too much. But so many cool things happen. So many neat pairings-up, with characters either reuniniting or meeting each other for the first time. I am now hoping for a Tormund Giantsbane and the Hound road movie. Momentous truths are revealed. You get rewarded with callback after callback. And there's a nod to the Dirty Dozen. And the cultivation of a strange boner I wasn't quite sure how to feel about. Some of the things that you were hoping would happen, happens. And some don't. There are epic, boss battles. I swear, the sheer amount of logistics and choreography that went into staging these combat sequences are staggering in scope - although, okay, they still fall short of the stupendous Battle of the Bastards, maybe because Miguel Sapochnik didn't direct any moment of Season 7. Also, someone invents the wheelchair in Westeros. Progress, baby! This is how you do it, Season 8 of The Walking Dead.","",0,NA,5,"R2W028ZDHFMV88","""Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe.""","H.

"B074RKHNV6",2018-05-17,"Huge fan...I've read all the books, seen all the episodes portrayed on screen. Contrary to a tiny inner voice that worries me, each approaching season, that these productions may ""peter-out,"" Season 7 does not disappoint. On the one hand, George R. R. Martin is a master at creating deep, varied and interesting female characters, such as I've never seen in one place before. Thank you, George! And, WOW! Who are you?...What's more, in general, is that human drama takes precedence over male and female stereotypes. Somewhere between the primal, the ""sophisticated"" and the supernatural, we still vicariously reach forward with equal longing in Season 7, as in previous seasons, to find balance, harmony and happiness in the human status, to feel vindication, to find redemption, to feel victory, to find rest at last in a ""primal"" justice that won't be quashed. All this played out on a backdrop of castles, nature and WOW the dragons are more amazing than ever!

"B074RKHNV6",2018-04-23,"This is a good season with some amazing set pieces and a quickened pace towards what will ultimately be the climax of the show. The only problem is that the pace, while kind of nice, feels very out of place with the rest of the show. Sometimes, it would take almost an entire season for a group to reach their intended destination; and in this season, it would take only an episode even though it should have been a long journey. Some things that I would have liked to have seen were only touched on because of this. It doesn't ruin the season, as it's still very exciting, but I think the decision shorten to 7 episodes was a mistake. I'd also like to note that the digital file IS available to be redeemed on iTunes, as have been all of the other GoT seasons. Also, the digital copy appears to redeem ALL 7 SEASONS of the show, not just season 7. It did this both on iTunes and Vudu, but the redemption code card only made mention of season 7, not all seasons. The seasons don't appear to have the short extra featurettes that came with the other season redemptions, and the episodes are all listed together under ""season 0"" in iTunes. So this means, having all seasons in iTunes, I have seasons 0 (from this blu ray), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. This is kind of annoying since it's organized so poorly.","",0,NA,5,"R25F9BMNKMJPVZ","Good season, confusing digital redemption information","JWS","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2018",2018,"April","Monday","2018/04","Q2",2018 Q2,"the United States"

"B074RKHNV6",2018-03-05,"This appears to be the penultimate set. At least hoping that the series will be completed in one more season. The story-line was great, but note disc problems below. Received the product in December 2017, but didn't get into re-watching the first six seasons until after the Winter Olympics. When I finally watched Season Seven, I was disappointed to discover that there were a couple of scuffs on Disc 3, which corrupted both episodes 5 & 6. Was able to skip by the damage with fast forward, but was unable to view roughly 10 percent of each episode. Episode 5 from minute 22:21 - 26:37 and Episode 6 most of the battle on the frozen lake. This is the second time something like this has happened to me (first was in viewing the entire compilation of Weeds DVD's), again had five episodes with scratch/scuffing problems. I advise checking all discs for possible scratches/scuffs, as soon as the product is received., even though that means opening the product well in advance of watching the DVDS. I currently have over 90 unopened DVD's/sets pending in my library.

"B074RKHNV6",2018-02-26,"Through the seasons I have really enjoyed this show. After reading the books there was no doubt they would have to cut much of the material out of the show, but I still found myself liking the show. The first season started off strong, and later seasons were pretty good but it seemed to be fading a bit until I saw season seven and I think that the show came back stronger. The building tension of the coming winter and the war between the houses was interesting, but even better to see that now winter is here. I cannot wait to see what season eight holds, and even if it's not the ending I necessarily hope for it is good to know that they will end the show, rather than letting it fall prey to poor writing like so many other shows do.","",0,NA,4,"R3HMAS8G1HLIRW","Through the seasons I have really enjoyed this show","AngelOfDementia","False","Game","Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2018",2018,"February","Monday","2018/02","Q1",2018 Q1,"the United States"

"B08J88JPN8",2021-07-16,"I have 4 kids ages 1 to 7. I am definitely all about toys that are 100% outdoor. So these big connect 4 games that say they can go outdoors have been on my radar. But, I have held off on getting one because there were off brands, which I don't trust, then there was ECR4kids which seems like it has enough kids stuff that it's kind of a brand but the reviews for the ECR4kids ones say that the plastic part along the bottom pops out randomly and dumps the playing pieces out. So, I had held off, but then was excited to get the Amazon Basics version when it came out, since Amazon Basics tends to be OK, and since I hopefully will avoid the defect in the ECR4kids ones. I got the 44 inch wide Amazon Basics connect 4 huge outdoor game, because it's outdoors. It's not in the house. May as well go big. I had planned to leave it out all the time. (More on that later...) So far, so good. The big set was pretty easy to set up. It pops together then comes apart, and it comes with a giant huge canvas carrying case. You have to take it apart to put it in the carrying case, and honestly when it is ""stored"" it is huge and it weighs 37 pounds, so it's not easy to carry. But, you could put this in the backseat of a car if needed. Then the plastic things along the bottom that hold the playing pieces in place when playing seem sturdy enough so far. That was the part with a design flaw in many reviews I had read on competing brands. I've only had this set up a couple of days, so it's possible they will wear out over time, but as of now they work all the time and don't drop the pieces down until you pull the lever to release the playing pieces. One problem with this: The product description says that this is indoor outdoor. I think that might mean that you can set it up outdoors to play, but not to store it permanently set up outside. It's designed to where in rain, a bit of water will get into it. Each of the round donut shaped playing pieces has a small hole on the edge to where if you held the piece underwater, water would get inside. And, left outside in rain, almost certainly a bit of water will get inside. Then that will get moldy. And then the white pieces will be blotchy to where you can see the mold. (I got the style with a grey and red frame, and with black and white pieces.) I think it's OK to store the frame outside, and keep it set up, but maybe plan to bring the playing pieces inside and have a dedicated place to store them where they won't get rained on. Or, at the least, pick a color with dark or bold colored playing pieces for both sides, and avoid white or yellow playing pieces, so that if water gets in and they get moldy it won't show. Update: Outdoor storage is a MAJOR PROBLEM: So, it is now mid-August, meaning I have had this big huge connect 4 for about 5 weeks. I got it specifically for a big outdoor game that won't clutter my house. Well, in just under 5 weeks outside, the red plastic for the board has noticeably faded. You know how some plastics are treated to be UV resistant and can be kept outside for years. Welp, I am pretty sure this toy is not like that. I think that when they say it's OK for outdoors that they mean you can temporarily set it up outside for a few games, but then you have to disassemble and store it inside. What a bummer. I had wanted to leave it permanently out beside the patio, and get several years of use. But I think the plastic is going to age fast and do that thing where it gets super brittle from sunlight. I will continue to update, but if you are looking to set it up outdoors long term, like for a home daycare, or a yard toy for kids, I am very doubtful that it will last long. And, based on that design flaw, I'm now a little worried that the plastic of this isn't UV resistant and that it will get brittle left out to weather. I will plan to update the review, but when plastic weathers badly it's usually a couple of years and then it gets brittle, so any update will be slow coming. By the way, the kids do seem to like to play. I thought that they would be most interested in filling it up with pieces, then pulling the bottom to the side in order to drop all the pieces, but actually they seem to like to play. The oldest has played connect 4 in after school, and even the 3 year old seemed to be able to understand the concept (although she wanted to put multiple pieces in on her turn in order to get 4 in a row and win, so maybe a little young for really nailing taking turns). I think it's an OK game for younger elementary students. Overall, this seems like a nice big outdoor connect 4 set. When I shopped these last year, lots of different brands of the big huge game are available, but they either were complete drop shipper off brands or they had a design flaw where the piece along the bottom that holds game pieces in place during play would tend to detach from the weight. This Amazon Basics one is to where the piece along the bottom stays in place just fine, so this seems like a good option for giant connect 4. One potential problem is that small holes in the hollow plastic pieces mean that if you store it outside, water will get into each playing piece when it rains, meaning yucky water later dripping out during play and meaning mold can grow inside the pieces to where you can see blotches through the plastic. So, it's really not great for completely uncovered outdoor use. Nevertheless, I suspect that issue will be the case for other sets as well. I do think that compared to the available options, this is a good option for a giant outdoor connect 4 set.","",4,NA,5,"RRYWS9CVL2RX8","Sturdy enough for unsupervised little kids; works well; not intended to be stored outside","Gagewyn","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2021",2021,"July","Friday","2021/07","Q3",2021 Q3,"the United States"

"B08J88JPN8",2021-07-14,"This item arrived in a few large pieces and without excessive packaging. The instructions are clear and the pieces easily snap together. The size and function is exactly as expected. We've played these giant connect 4 games previously out at parks or bars and always thought it'd be neat to have one out on our deck. There are many color options and I chose one that matched our outdoor decor. However, if you didn't want to leave this out all the time it does come with a carrying case. You need to disassemble the game to put it in the case. I have two young kids that love to play with this. It's a little too high for my 2.5 year old to reach the top but we use a step stool. It's also a big hit at parties. I'll likely leave this out all summer but put it away for the winter. Once assembled, it's not too heavy to move around. There are plenty of pieces included for any length of game. Overall I'm very pleased with it.","",0,NA,5,"RJRX5827FY81N","So easy to put together","Ashley S","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2021",2021,"July","Wednesday","2021/07","Q3",2021 Q3,"the United States"

Ammetto che me lo aspettavo grande ma non così! È davvero enorme ma soprattutto è ben fatto e robusto. Ben fatta sia la struttura che le pedine e questo gli garantisce una durata del tempo non indifferente. Noi lo abbiamo messo in giardino e i miei figli ci giocano davvero tantissimo. Essendo realizzato in plastica davvero robusta non ho riscontrato nessun problema né con il sole e nemmeno con la pioggia. Ovviamente in inverno verrà riposto per evitare che si rovini con le interperie più rigide. ( viene fornito con la sacca porta pezzi) Sono rimasta davvero sorpresa dalla robustezza, le pedine sono fatte benissimo e sono abbastanza pesanti, tanto da dover fare attenzione quando si fanno scendere. Comodissimi anche i porta pedine laterali che rendono il gioco pratico sia durante l'utilizzo che quando è inutilizzato. Non conosco il prezzo al momento, quindi non me la sento di assegnare cinque stelle perché non posso valutare l'aspetto del rapporto qualità prezzo.

It comes in a big box and there is a little bit of assembly required but doesn't take long. It is the classic game of Connect 4. All the ring parts can be stored on the sides of it so they don't get lost. The plastics are solid, it is constructed well. It stands up sturdy and doesn't tip over and it has a bit of weight to the whole thing. I like the colourful design and my kids love it. Comes with a bag to keep it all in when you are not playing with it but I like it as it means I can take it found friend's houses too.

"B00GWR2S78",2017-08-19,"I love the show in general. Some of the childish bantering between Blue and Keira is absolutely annoying. Malik and his irresponsible narcissism is consistently entertaining, and Jason dealing with an African-American wife versus the sweet loving cheerful Kelly Pitts makes for a nice twist. Tasha and her romances keep us tuning in for every episode. The acting is top notch. Personally I was getting annoyed with Melanie and Darwin so I'm glad Melanie pursued her career goal. I think that is very realistic. So the only complaint I have is the childish reactions that Keira and Blue go through. I can't imagine an adult football player and an adult actress acting so stupid and childish. Melanie and Darwin were similar - particularly Darwin- but at least both would admit their faulty judgements and would grow. But Blue and Keira act like 5th graders. Overall is the best entertainment I've seen in years.","",0,NA,5,"RY17QBG0C9RR1","I love the show in general","g. i. joe","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2017",2017,"August","Saturday","2017/08","Q3",2017 Q3,"the United States"

"B00GWR2S78",2014-09-19,"This season of The Game marks the beginning of the end for this show. When it was part of the CW, it was funny, had substance, and also had a heart. The move to BET and Atlanta made this show more somber, out of place, disconnected, and both confusing for the viewers and (probably also) the writers and creators. Even though we had most of the cast back, two years after the cancellation, it felt very different, and not just because it moved to Atlanta. The main loss of the show where is the move to multiple camera production and the switch from a sitcom to a dramedy. A sitcom should remain a sitcom, if only because it had already accumulated fans with certain expectations and needs that could not be fulfilled with a drastic genre change. The storylines are a mess, though not as much of a mess as in the seasons to come, and even the slightest bit of humor is incomparable to the amount of tragedy and drama.","",10,NA,2,"RDLZHP2Z5EH7Q","Oh, The Game, how the mighty have fallen..","Em G","True","Game","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2014",2014,"September","Friday","2014/09","Q3",2014 Q3,"the United States"

The larger ones however are a complete joke”. While this purchaser was referring to the ability of filling the water pistols, my immediate concern is that neither of the larger water pistols work - as in have never worked. So difficult to fill because of design issues and, well, just don’t function when once you’re able to do so - design and quality issues.

"B085KW2P19",2021-07-04,"Although the concept of this water pistol is great, and the water pistols slide apart quite well, the flaw with the design of the water pistol is filling it up. It is near impossible to fill up by submerging in a bucket of water, and to fill up with a tap, you need the tap on so low that it takes ages to fill. If tap put on any quicker then you waste more water than you use! Item Returned. Not Recomended","",0,NA,2,"R3TWY8B2UBVZKS","","A. M.

The larger ones however are a complete joke to fill, the filler hole is the same size as on the smaller guns but you simply cannot fill them by submerging in large body of water, air does not escape from the gun and water does not go in, I tried filling them with a measuring jug with small spout and that takes an age, by the time you have filled one and started on the second the kids have already emptied the first one and you are forever on filling duty.
